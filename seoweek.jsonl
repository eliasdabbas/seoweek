I am super excited. If you haven\u2019t already gotten your tickets, we\u2019re talking the end of April, the 28th to May 1st, New York City, the best, most prolific, most amazing dynamic speakers across SEO, data, AI, and content. I am so excited today to be joined by Bianca Anderson. She is speaking there. She is the organic growth manager at Hims and Hers. Hey, Bianca, how are you doing today? Bianca:  I\u2019m doing wonderful. I\u2019m doing wonderful. It\u2019s Friday. I\u2019ve already had my coffee. Can\u2019t complain too much. Garrett : The weather\u2019s starting to get warm. You\u2019re in Chicago, I\u2019m in Virginia, still feeling our cold spells. It\u2019s always going to be windy. I\u2019m actually in like a super windy area as well, but not to get into cliches, I want to dive right in and talk too, talk about the world of SEO. You\u2019re in growth. The last 12, 24 months have been wild in marketing and SEO. Where do we stand from your perspective? What\u2019s the current state of search? Bianca:  Yeah, well, I mean, to quote the great Bob Dylan, \u201cthe times, they are a changing.\u201d I think we\u2019re in a very strange, transient state where a lot of things are happening. And I think none of it has been settled. With AI overviews, there\u2019s still a lot of unknowns in terms of, I mean, we don\u2019t even have tracking capabilities within Google Search Console yet. I guess I say yet optimistically. And also, there\u2019s been a huge hit with these AI overviews to informational searches. And I think there\u2019s a lot of implications of that. I think something like 99% of informational searches are being hit with AI overviews. And so, what are the implications of that? I think the way that, well, it tends to be that informational searches draw in a lot of traffic. The lower in the funnel you go, the less traffic is kind of there. So, I think that there are implications to that in terms of what our expectations can be around growth, how we view traffic as a metric, and so many other things. But yeah, I think we\u2019re currently in a transient stage, lots of unknowns. Oh, and to put it all, to add another thing to the mix, I think Google\u2019s over-reliance on Reddit and other forums, I\u2019m hoping is another transient thing that\u2019s not going to stay. I think it\u2019s currently maybe a Band-Aid that Google is doing to try and give users or searchers more experience-driven content. But yeah, a lot of things are going on in the mix and there\u2019s a lot of unknowns. And yeah, but what is known, informational searches are being hit for sure. Garrett : And it\u2019s a perfect segue because you being an organic growth manager, organic growth manager at SEOs, we\u2019re all so frustrated because we\u2019ve all felt so entitled to this traffic for so long. But it\u2019s like, your talk is all about like F traffic, fuck traffic, I\u2019m going to say it, \u201cfuck traffic.\u201d I\u2019m so excited to hear your perspective because attribution has been a major conversation in the marketing industry, like executives want it, and yet there\u2019s always this issue of like, are we tracking and focusing on the right measure? So, can you give a preview about your talk and kind of why someone should come and what they\u2019re going to learn from you at SEO Week? Bianca:  Yeah, so yeah, very colorful title, but I have to admit. Garrett : Love it. Bianca:  But yeah, so as I said, we all know informational queries are being hit. Those tend to be the type of queries that do generate a lot of traffic. I think that in the midst of that, there needs to be more of a focus on the lower of the funnel converting traffic, the traffic that, sorry, the lower of the funnel converting URLs that generate the largest submissions or whatever your key converting metrics are. So, in my time as an SEO, every site I\u2019ve worked for, they followed kind of Pareto\u2019s principle. So 20% of the URLs on the site are generating 80% of the submissions or whatever, again, conversions. And so I think with that, there\u2019s this real importance to have these pages endure the constant shifts of the algorithm to really have a closer eye on their performance. And I think that with this talk, that\u2019s going to be a huge focus is how can we kind of treat these 20% of URLs as more of a kind of VIP type of thing, giving them special care. But it\u2019s also not just a, what is the word? Offensive, okay, offensive, defensive. It\u2019s both offensive and defensive. Garrett : I like that. Bianca:  In the sense that I\u2019m saying, let\u2019s preserve what we have in terms of the high converting URLs that we\u2019re noticing on a site. But also this framework will help you identify potentially new high converting URLs that are not at their full potential yet. Maybe they\u2019re not getting as much traffic as they can get. And so there\u2019s ways to optimize for that as well. So I think this talk is really going to center around, okay, we\u2019re in this time where traffic is down. Okay, so what does that mean? What are we weighing as the most important metrics to consider? And so, yeah, the title is very colorful, but I think the overall message is that we just need to just center traffic as a core metric. And we need to look at other metrics. And in doing so, start to really treat the URLs that are driving our core KPIs with a little bit more TLC, love and care and whatnot. Garrett : I love it. I\u2019m so excited because I think that regardless if you are a scrappy startup or a massive enterprise, you are still so hyper-aware of resource and budget allocation. And your focus is, it\u2019s not a spray and pray. It\u2019s like, let\u2019s actually make sure that we\u2019re spending the money in the right place. That\u2019s going to drive the important metrics and using traffic in an almost mature, responsible way to do that. I love the approach. So, what\u2019s something that people can do right now that you preach, that you\u2019re like, this is a tactic that I think you got to get behind? Bianca:  Yeah, I mean, it\u2019s kind of simple, but I do think there\u2019s a lot of merit in taking stock of your current URLs and doing an audit that\u2019s focused on just conversions. Like seeing what type of topics or topic clusters are among the high converting cohort. And then from there, I would recommend doing audits to see if there\u2019s any green space left, if you\u2019ve exhausted that. Because I think it\u2019s really good to see what is performing well in the realm of conversions and then trying to exhaust that. And then once that\u2019s exhausted, trying to preserve what you\u2019ve got. So I would say do an audit that is centered around conversions. See if there\u2019s any trends you can suss out between like topics that tend to lead to more conversions and then go from there in terms of prioritizing new content and prioritizing optimizations. And in my talk, I will give a more structured framework, wink, wink, but yes, that\u2019s what I would say. Garrett : I love it. I mean, it\u2019s like, yeah, you get to really be the detective and uncover. The interesting thing about it is like you do this right and you find the revenue and you are all of a sudden like a hero in your organization because that\u2019s what C-Suite cares about. Bianca:  Exactly. It\u2019s a lot more, it\u2019s very sexy work. It\u2019s very sexy work, I\u2019d say. Garrett : Very sexy, I love that. No, so speaking of sexy, what\u2019s next? The future of search, there\u2019s all different directions, all different perspectives. Nobody fricking knows. What\u2019s your take? Bianca:  I think we\u2019re leading, we\u2019re going into an era where Google doesn\u2019t quite have the monopoly that it has had in years past. From an ethical standpoint, I\u2019m all for that. Like boo to monopolies. From a practical everyday standpoint, I do anticipate learning curves as we try to figure out what it looks like to optimize for channels outside of Google search, which is exciting, but there\u2019s going to be learning curves and growing pains and whatnot. I also, I would like to think that Google\u2019s over-reliance on Reddit and other forums is not a sustainable long-term thing. I think that as more and more sites start to prioritize experience, expertise, authoritativeness, trustworthiness, content will be, more content will be on the SERPs that is experience-driven and can compete, I guess, with whatever Google sees in this Reddit takeover of content. And so I think that is going to continue to be a very important thing. Search is becoming more democratized. Great, great, but still lots of unknowns there. Yeah, and I think informational queries, yes, the hits that we have seen from AI overviews, I don\u2019t think that\u2019s going to subside at all. I think that in turn, our expectations around what SEO can give as a marketing channel are going to change. That doesn\u2019t mean that it\u2019s dead. It just means that we\u2019re shifting our focus a little bit into other ways that we can convey the value of SEO to stakeholders. Garrett : Oh my God, I\u2019m with you on so much of that. AI overviews, you touched on a few times. What\u2019s your personal take? Do you like them? Have you used any other like AI search channels? Do you find yourself doing that? Or are you just like, \u201cNope, not for me.\u201d Bianca:  You know, it\u2019s so hard to say sometimes because I hope I\u2019m not too biased by my profession, but I will say, I think AR overviews are cool. I think there\u2019s been instances where they\u2019re pulling from sources that like Reddit, like forums, where it\u2019s like, \u201cHmm, I don\u2019t know how trustworthy I can feel that they are.\u201d But as a user, I think, yeah, I think for informational queries, it is a really great way to get what you\u2019re looking for very quickly, which explains why informational queries have gotten such a hit. But yeah, I think this is a tool that Google continues to refine on. And so it\u2019s a lot better than when they first released, what was it, SGE. So yeah, I think it\u2019s doing its thing. There\u2019s still some areas of improvement and maybe I\u2019m biased as an SEO and that\u2019s what\u2019s driving me to say that, or maybe not. But yeah, no, it\u2019s cool stuff. Garrett : It\u2019s interesting. I mean, it\u2019s so controversial and it\u2019s such in our wheelhouse and it makes what we do fun. I cannot wait for your talk. Thank you so much for joining me today. I really appreciate it. Bianca:  Thank you. This has been great. So excited. Garrett : Oh my God. So, if you haven\u2019t got your tickets, SEO Week, end of April, New York City, come join us, chill with Bianca and me and all the other awesome SEOs and content markers and growth managers that are going to be there.

If you haven\u2019t already gotten your tickets, you gotta come see Talia and me in New York, April 28th to May 2nd. You are going to see 35+ amazing speakers across marketing, content, SEO, AI, you name it. It\u2019s going to be fantastic. Today, as I mentioned, I am joined by Talia Wolf. She is the founder and CEO of GetUplift. Thank you so much for joining me today. Talia, what is going on? \u00a0 Talia : Thank you so much for having me. I\u2019m so excited. I\u2019m like, this is going to be incredible. I can\u2019t wait for this conference. \u00a0 Garrett : We\u2019re just saying it\u2019s like a family reunion because it\u2019s like there\u2019s so many people who have been in these industries so long, but everyone\u2019s also learning on the fly. The fundamentals stay the same, but everything\u2019s changing, which kind of brings me, let\u2019s dive in. The whole world of SEO and search is evolving. From your perspective, especially in the context of CRO, what\u2019s the current state of search? \u00a0 Talia : Yeah, so, you know, as I said, like I\u2019m a conversion optimization specialist. This is what I do. I think one of the most incredible things that I\u2019m seeing right now, finally, so like 10 years ago, I got on stage at Search Love, which I think was like my first SEO conference that I ever spoke at. And I spoke about conversion optimization and emotion. And my feedback was the CRO and emotion isn\u2019t relevant to SEO. That was my feedback. And so I\u2019m psyched that fast forward to 2025 and people are starting to see the connection finally. So what\u2019s really incredible is as you think about SEO and search, if you really want to convert, you have to understand that all search intent is emotional. And I know it\u2019s kind of hard to think that way because we think in like keywords and search terms, but really when you use tools like Also Asked, for example, you can really easily see that a single simple search for like an accounting software turns into very emotional search terms where people are trying to figure out their pains, their challenges, how are they going to solve this problem? So I really do think that one of the most important things that people can be thinking about right now is how do you understand real intent, the humans behind the screen, not the product and the solution that you\u2019re selling. Why are people coming to you? What are they trying to achieve on an emotional level so that then you can serve them better content? \u00a0 Garrett : I love that. And I mean, it really speaks to how audience research has never been more important. We always talk about this kind of overlap between the people and the search engine algorithms, but really understanding the humanity is so critical, which kind of leads right into what is the topic? Why should people come and see you speak at SEO week? What are you going to be educating us about? \u00a0 Talia : Great question. So actually I\u2019m going to be talking about the one thing that AI can\u2019t touch right now. So in an AI obsessed world, technology changes, but people don\u2019t. So what I\u2019m going to be talking about during this talk is really about how your prospects are making decisions on an emotional level. I\u2019m going to get into the psychological triggers and the most common emotions that really impact decision-making. And hopefully anyone watching will be able to immediately uncover how their customers are making decisions and then how to convert more of those people. So I\u2019m really just going to dive into that human psychology and obviously tie it back to SEO and CRO. \u00a0 Garrett : Oh my God, preach. I\u2019m so excited for your talk \u2019cause that\u2019s like one of my personal obsessions. So I will be front and center in the front row watching everything psychology, just soaking it in. But what can people do right now practically in their copy, in their marketing that you recommend to improve their visibility? \u00a0 Talia:  I think one of the most important things is to start thinking about intent, which is, you know, it sounds funny in search \u2019cause like, of course I\u2019m thinking about search intent, but really uncovering that biggest pain, the one reason that led people to land on your website or your landing page or a blog post, what led them? What was that pivotal moment that made them search for a solution like yours and tie it to that pain? You can do that with all sorts of different ways, customer interviews, surveys to your customers or for your prospect on your website, but just trying to uncover that pain will help you tremendously in just auditing your website, looking at those pages and asking yourself, \u201cAm I actually solving problems for people or am I just selling?\u201d And there\u2019s a distinct difference there between me saying, \u201cHey, this is the biggest pain that our prospects are feeling right now\u201d and \u201cHere\u2019s me solving that on a page versus here\u2019s my solution, please buy it.\u201d And that is the biggest thing I can tell you right now. Like if you are just looking for one thing, definitely try to dig into that main pain and I\u2019ll teach you on stage exactly how to do that with the step-by-step process, but for now, I want you to start thinking about that. That\u2019s more important than copy, design, everything. \u00a0 Garrett : I love it. I mean, you\u2019ve got so many great frameworks that you\u2019ve really iterated and nailed over the years. So that\u2019ll be some juicy stuff to get at this conference. And then finally, what comes next? What do you think is going to happen with search going forward? How are you thinking about it? \u00a0 Talia:  I don\u2019t know. I\u2019m not, I don\u2019t like to do like predictions, but the one thing I will say is I think that as the world rushes to leverage AI, we\u2019re going to be in a situation even more than today where everyone sounds the same. And you\u2019re going to start competing with even more noise and even more competitors out there. So I think one of the most key things that people should start focusing on is that psychology and emotion part. And I think that that is where the future lies. I think those that can remember and understand and be customer first, those are the ones that are going to win. Because obviously with AI, at least right now, what you put in is what you get out. And if you don\u2019t want to sound like everyone else and you don\u2019t want to be on this hamster wheel of just not knowing what to do to increase conversions, the human side is the key to everything. \u00a0 Garrett : Do you think as someone who thinks about the way that humans interact with technology and with copying content, do you see us gravitating towards that more natural language sort of focus with search? Or do you think Google will continue to be like where people are so used to putting like specific keywords? Like, how do you think search behavior will change? \u00a0 Talia : Well, I can even just speak to myself. I used to search on Google all the time. Now I\u2019m in chat GPT, I\u2019m in Perplexity. I\u2019m just using that because it helps me brainstorm the way it\u2019s just serving me in a much better way than Google does. And it\u2019s not that it\u2019s something that\u2019s done differently. It\u2019s just the way the content is served in a way that I can keep engaging it and keep asking questions and perfect it. So, I think ultimately, you know, it\u2019s not about who\u2019s using ChatGPT to write copy, who\u2019s like using visuals. It\u2019s about  how  you use it, what prompts are using, how well of an understanding do you have of your customers beyond age and geographical location and the browser that they\u2019re using and more about those triggers. So yeah, it\u2019s definitely changing. And I think companies that don\u2019t adapt are going to be left behind. \u00a0 Garrett : I love it. There you go. So many fascinating tidbits that you\u2019ll be able to get from Talia\u2019s presentation. So! If you haven\u2019t already, get your ticket, April 28th to May 2nd in New York City for SEO Week. Thanks again. My name is Garrett and we\u2019ll see you soon.

If you haven\u2019t gotten your tickets yet, it\u2019s coming up April 28th to May 1st, New York City. We are being joined by 36 of the most amazing speakers across obviously SEO, content strategy, AI, data, you name it. And today I\u2019m joined by Mr. Everywhere, Distribute All the Things. He\u2019s even got a book out if you haven\u2019t gotten it \u2013 Create Once, Distribute Forever. Ross Simmonds, the founder and CEO at Foundation. How you doing, man? Ross : I\u2019m doing well, Garrett. Super excited for SEO Week. If folks are listening to this, they better get their tickets. I\u2019m pumped. Our conversation there is going to be fun and I\u2019m excited to be here. Thanks for having me on. Garrett : Yeah, thanks. I\u2019m so excited just to, like every time we chat, it\u2019s so much fun because not only do we have a lot in common between the Eagles and young daughters and all that, but like, SEO is wild right now. The last 12 to 24 months. So I want to dive in, like, \u00a0brain dump. What is the state of search from your perspective? Ross:  To me, the state of search is a little chaotic, but beautiful at the same time. And I think folks are really feeling the pressure because the shifts in my opinion are great for the industry. The shifts are, there\u2019s some shifts that have not served smaller businesses well. I will acknowledge that. But at a high level, at a high level, I think it is moving marketers in the right direction because as SEOs, we have over, in my opinion, oriented towards things that don\u2019t really matter too much in the wonderful world of capitalism and business. And we have forgotten about the fundamentals of marketing and now we are forced to recognize that yes, links matter, all of these things matter, but as the AI starts to take shape, you have to start putting yourself in the shoes of your customers more. You have to think more intentionally around search intent, but not just search intent, but like finally\u2026remember for the last like 10 years, everybody talked about voice search is going to change the world and then Siri sucked and nobody like got the results they wanted. So many people are using voice. Oh, you hear that? Garrett : There you go. Ross:  You hear that? Siri\u2019s mad at me now, but it\u2019s like, now people can grab ChatGPT, Perplexity, Claude, and have a conversation. And the conversation is scattered. They\u2019re going in and they\u2019re having these dialogues. And that is a discovery experience. And to me, I think search with the sole focus on Google, Google, Google is now shifting in a great way because now the search is happening on Reddit. The search is happening on TikTok. The search is happening on YouTube, through Claude, Perplexity, ChatGPT, all of these different things. \u201cAh, I\u2019m overwhelmed,\u201d screams a lot of the folks who have traditionally exclusively thought about search in the lens of Google. But in reality, now we have to think like marketers. Now we have to think about not just ranking for a certain keyword and then stuffing it and all that stuff and maybe building a few links. We now have to think about, \u201chow can we create a piece of content that\u2019s worth reading? How can I create that at scale so I can ensure that I\u2019m optimizing for all of the different areas? How can I create a system where I\u2019m producing videos about this content because it now needs to show up in YouTube and YouTube\u2019s also showing up in the SERP. So maybe I should be creating a YouTube video at scale for all of these pieces. So I\u2019m targeting the keyword twice, all of these things.\u201d Plus, don\u2019t forget, Reddit is now showing up. So how do I start to infiltrate and communicate on Reddit? To me, it\u2019s chaotic but beautiful. And brands are easily overwhelmed by it. But if you can take a step back and go back to first principles and think about high quality content, understand your audience, understand intent and develop stories and create stories that are optimized in the ways that of course are aligned with double ease and all those things, then you can win. And I think that\u2019s a beautiful situation for all of us. Garrett : So, so well said and you\u2019re right, it is chaotic. We were like kind of threading this needle right now of like needing to plan but needing to be off the cuff and authentic. Needing to be organized but needing to address all the things, which it also leads\u2026I mean, your bread and butter has been Reddit. It leads right into your presentation. Can you give us a preview about AI and UGC and what you\u2019re going to be delivering at SEO Week? Ross:  So excited for this talk. I\u2019ve never given it before. I wrote a book on Reddit marketing in like 2018 or something like that. So like, I\u2019ve been in the trenches with Reddit for quite some time. And we\u2019re doing research right now where we\u2019re scraping and analyzing tons of subreddits. We\u2019re gathering that new data. We\u2019re cross-referencing that against keywords. We\u2019re also cross-referencing that against like some of the queries and responses within ChatGPT and Claude and how they\u2019re using Reddit to influence their responses. We all know that Reddit has amazing licensing deals with Google, as well as with OpenAI. We\u2019re using all of this to create an insight and confirm some of the hypotheses that we\u2019ve already validated with clients. So right now, we\u2019re producing content for clients that is intentionally built for Reddit. We\u2019re currently working with clients to understand how to show up in Reddit in a way that doesn\u2019t get you banned. We\u2019re helping our clients understand how to add value to Reddit and how to stop viewing things like karma as just, like, a qualitative metric that doesn\u2019t matter when in reality, and our data is showing that it does matter. So we\u2019re doing a lot of research around Reddit as a platform. We\u2019re combining that with our experience around search. We\u2019re taking insights and data from all of the other great marketers out there. We have a bunch of tools that we\u2019re using to gather this insight. And the goal for my presentation is twofold: one: To say like, folks, it is now time to wake up to Reddit. It\u2019s not going anywhere. There\u2019s a reason why they have a multi-million, maybe billion-dollar contract with Google. There\u2019s a reason why they\u2019ve IPO\u2019d and have had a successful business. It\u2019s not going anywhere. So let me give you the playbook that we\u2019ve used for years with clients, but also\u2026let me give you some data that you can take back to your team to showcase why Reddit matters and what it\u2019s going to look like in the future. And that\u2019s the goal. The goal is to share as much as I can. You know me, I go in with the strategy, but I\u2019m also going to get tactical with folks and give it all there. So I\u2019m pumped for it. It\u2019s going to be very transparent, give away all the secrets, and folks should be able to leave there fired up and ready to go. Garrett : Dude, I\u2019m so psyched. I mean, because it\u2019s like, for a lot of brands, Reddit is really scary, and it doesn\u2019t have to be. I think the way that you think about it makes a ton of sense. And there\u2019s so much value there. Like it\u2019s still early in a weird way. Ross : So early. And I think that\u2019s one of the other key takeaways. It\u2019s like, you\u2019re still early because most brands are still afraid. And because most brands are still afraid, you probably have like a year to figure this stuff out. Like we have time on our side because when Reddit shows up, it doesn\u2019t get approved right away. Why? Because everybody has these preconceived contexts of what they believe Reddit is and it doesn\u2019t get the traction. That\u2019s okay. Because if you\u2019re early, then you can capitalize now because in the future, guess what? A lot of those threads that are ranking in the SERP are going to get archived. That\u2019s what the algorithm does. So, if you can get in there before it\u2019s archived with high value content, and you can ensure that that content is at the top because it\u2019s valuable, you\u2019re going to get referral traffic from Reddit in a way that you haven\u2019t before. Most brands are probably averaging like 1% or 2% of all referral traffic coming from Reddit. That\u2019s horrific, right? It\u2019s literally one of the top three websites in the world. You should be able to move the needle and start to see that trajectory happening with your content. So, the goal here is to help folks see how to make that change, how to see that move. And with the state of search, diversifying your ability to generate traffic through organic and visibility and share a voice through Reddit is a no brainer in my opinion. So that\u2019s all what we\u2019re going to be diving into. And it\u2019s exciting. It\u2019s going to be fun. I\u2019m going to have a blast up there. And I\u2019m sure some people will leave there feeling a little bit more nervous than excited, but hey, that\u2019s a part of the game. Garrett : Dude, in a weird way, Reddit is real. What is, okay, give us a taste. Give us a taste. What\u2019s like one tactic that you keep close to your chest that someone could do right now when it comes to Reddit? Ross:  The easiest thing would be to stop being afraid to have your own subreddit. Like, so many brands are afraid to have their own subreddit. You need to take, even if you\u2019re not trying to be active today, create your own subreddit before someone creates one for you, and then it is filled with NSFW content. Go and create and own your own subreddit. That\u2019s free advice. And you don\u2019t need to like brand it or anything. You\u2019re doing this for safety. You need to control your brand story. So number one, right now, if you are listening to this, if you\u2019re a CMO, if you\u2019re a leader, if you\u2019re a marketer, if you\u2019re an SEO, send a note to your team, send this conversation with me and Garrett and say, \u201clisten at this point in the podcast where he\u2019s talking about Reddit, we need to do this.\u201d And then you might be disappointed because somebody might\u2019ve already done it for you. And if that has happened, reach out to the mod and say, hey, can we have a conversation? And try to get it because you really want to have your own subreddit. Super low-hanging fruit, seems basic. It\u2019s like saying you should have a Facebook account, you should have a Google places, you should have a location on Google maps. It\u2019s that basic folks. You should own your subreddit and your brand. Garrett : That\u2019s exactly what I was saying. Like domains, variations of domains, social media handles, this and the other thing. Reddit subreddit, get it. Ross : Get it, get it, 100%, it\u2019s so key. Garrett : Dude, what\u2019s next? I mean, you\u2019re kind of touching on it, but what is next in the world of search? What do you think\u2019s coming down the pipeline over the next few years? Ross : So, I think there\u2019s a lot of cool conversations happening about it right now around like whether or not and how an increase in brand mentions is going to influence your visibility in the SERP. All of those things I believe are real. I think it\u2019s going to be more of a brand game more and more for businesses, which is cool because it means brands need to, again, just like start thinking like marketers a little bit more and thinking about how they can create valuable stories that are going to give them brand credibility. One of the other things that I think is coming down the pipe that is far, but I believe coming, is very much a more immersive search experience with the devices that we have. Like, I do believe that voice is finally getting into its moment, which not everyone has realized. And again, this is my very far take. Like, no one listen to this and be like, \u201cRoss just said that Google is dead and everything is changing and everybody\u2019s on open AI and all this stuff.\u201d No, no, no, no, no. I\u2019m a huge believer that the death of Google is way overestimated. I think that the demise of Google is way overestimated and everybody who says the search is dead is absolutely just saying it because it gets clicks on LinkedIn and shares on X. But in reality, if you look at the data, the vast majority of the search queries are still happening on Google. And the vast majority of people who are going to discover something go to Google. I still believe that that is going to be the case for probably the next like 10 years. Why? Because there\u2019s a whole demographic that I see all the time on the weekends when I go and see my mom, who is not touching ChatGPT, who is not touching Perplexity or Claude or any of those things. They will never touch them, but they also, that demographic carries the purse. Like if folks think about financial like stuff, like these folks have still the vast majority of the wealth in North America. Like it\u2019s not changing. So long rant for a simple question, but essentially my belief is in the next 15 to 20, we\u2019re going to live in a world where search is so immersed within us. It might be on a device like glasses or something. It could be today our computers, like the short term will be our laptops. You press a button and you can have a conversation with your computer and it\u2019s going to do the research for you and it\u2019s going to click things for you. All of those things is going to happen for you on your devices. That could, for the geeks, myself included, this is like two years, maybe three, maybe one, right? Like it\u2019s going to be quick, but for the masses, it\u2019s not going to roll out on that level. I don\u2019t think for quite some time. All that said, I know there\u2019s a lot of people who are going to be at SEO Week talking about this, talking about the innovation, talking about the future of search. I can\u2019t wait to break bread with them and to hear the conversations and hear what other people are doing. That\u2019s why I\u2019m so excited about the event. So again, you mentioned it earlier, but folks, if you haven\u2019t gotten your tickets, this is the place to go. It\u2019s going to be probably, in my opinion, one of the best SEO events in the last decade. I can\u2019t wait for it. It\u2019s going to be a blast. Garrett : Dude, thank you so much. This is so cool. And I can\u2019t wait to talk to you. I can\u2019t wait to find myself in a conversation like with you and Mike King and Aleyda Solis and all these great people, just breaking down, having conversations and just waxing philosophical because there\u2019s so many minds that we\u2019re all obsessed with this stuff. Ross:  Yeah, yeah. The lineup is gold. The lineup is absolutely gold. I think it\u2019s going to be jam-packed, moment after moment, just hard-hitting conversations from the science to the psychology to the future of it, the ecosystem.\u00a0It\u2019s going to be an amazing, amazing event. I\u2019m looking forward to it. Garrett : Well, there you go. I\u2019m going to get off it here. I\u2019m going to go make an SEO week subreddit. I can\u2019t believe I haven\u2019t already. Ross:  Let\u2019s do it. Garrett : Thank you so much for joining me, Ross. This has been awesome. Ross:  Thanks for having me on. Good to see you. Garrett : Good to see you. This is Garrett Sussman, iPullRank, and check us out. SEO Week, get your tickets now, seoweek.org.

If you haven\u2019t already gotten your tickets, we will be in New York City, April 28th through May 1st. It\u2019s going to be unbelievable, 36+ speakers across SEO content, AI, data. This is  the  conference; you need to show up. And today I am super excited because I am being joined by Ross Hudgens. Ross is the founder and CEO at Siege Media and he is going to tell us everything about content marketing and content strategy in the future. Yo, Ross, what\u2019s going on, man? Ross:  Not too much, excited to be here. Super pumped for the conference. It\u2019s going to be amazing. Garrett : Dude, our industry, we were just talking before this, is so in flux. The last 12 months, 24 months have been ridiculous and it\u2019s a significant impact to the way that agencies like ours are approaching content for our clients. What\u2019s your perspective on the current state of SEO, specifically in the context of content? Ross:  Yeah, I mean, things are evolving rapidly, of course. I mean, we gotta be super comfortable using AI to improve our content. Generally, I think that\u2019s important to stay cutting edge. Also, just on where the industry\u2019s going, I feel more diversification is needed. Like we\u2019re doing more, what we believe is traditional-feeling PR for our content and also thought leadership, and we\u2019re doing more things like customer stories and that kind of piece. And it\u2019s not that it doesn\u2019t support search. It\u2019s like, these are an aim to help search in a lot of ways. And that\u2019s our opinion, like you build brand and all those things, you contribute to that so much so\u2026I mean, there used to be a time where you could just do everything SEO and like that you\u2019d rank, but now you kinda of gotta be great all across the board. It seems like\u2026anyways, I don\u2019t know what you\u2019ve seen. Garrett : Yeah, no, absolutely. And I mean, everything feels so much more holistic. SEO feels so much more of a support channel than a peer discovery channel. And to your point, it\u2019s like content needs to service the audience more than just the specific channel. And it sounds like that\u2019s kind of the approach regardless of the format of it. Ross:  Yeah, exactly. Yeah, just thinking more organic growth, essentially like we\u2019re using that framing more and not just search. It\u2019s like we\u2019re contributing to referrals, direct traffic. And if you\u2019re not thinking about how you\u2019re impacting those things, that\u2019s probably going to be problematic for that search traffic as well. Garrett : Yeah, and so you\u2019re actually, your presentation, which I\u2019m super excited about, is kind of that content marketing playbook. Can you kind of of give a preview of why should people check out what you\u2019re going to be sharing and what you\u2019ll be talking about? Ross:  Yeah, I mean, as we kind of teed up there, so much of what we\u2019re doing day-to-day continues to evolve. So, I\u2019m going to share, essentially, how we\u2019ve evolved that playbook year over year, month over month, and what that currently looks like to drive performance for our clients. So kinda of hinted at some of that, but we\u2019re doing more like sales enablement content and thinking more about distribution outside of like cold outreach to the mid-tier bloggers for guest post links. Like\u2026that is in a new state of affairs and kind of sharing what feels most impactful and the results and the lessons and the failures is sort of the goal of that presentation. Garrett : I know, it\u2019s so cool because you, with all your impressive portfolio of clients, it\u2019s like you have a pulse on what is working, what\u2019s not. You guys are always experimenting. What is something that the audience can do right now, tactically, that you\u2019re recommending to people saying, get ahead of this? Ross:  Yeah, one easy kinda takeaway that I thought about more recently, especially if you\u2019re on the B2B side, very many companies will have dropdowns in their top nav where it\u2019s their use cases or solutions for that software, generally, or product. And then they\u2019ll have the verticals they service. And we\u2019re suggesting generally that you would have a mix of high-quality content that supports each of those connections. Like an example for us might be we do digital PR and we service FinTech. So we should have thought leadership content or sales enablement content that serves that two prongs and also case studies that support those two prongs. So if we build that, we\u2019re calling it like, and this is continually evolving so by the time I do the presentation, we\u2019ll call it something different, but like a sales enablement Atlas, like we need that map fully baked out to find all those coverage gaps where we\u2019re one, hopefully serving that user on our website to show them we know what we can do for digital PR for FinTech. And then when they get into our pipeline, have the case studies to actually then close that deal. But a lot of companies will have many holes in that process. Like they don\u2019t have certain case studies, maybe they just can\u2019t get them, but also, they don\u2019t have any like content that supports like actually ever getting that client in the door from a lead standpoint. So that kind of matrix idea is when we\u2019re leveraging. And I think anyone can do that map in the B2B space and be like, do we have the proper coverage across all of these? If not, that\u2019s some close some deals left on the table. Garrett : I love it because it\u2019s, you know, sometimes like once you initially do your site architecture, it feels like an afterthought and to kind of revisit that, come back to it and then think about it in the same way that, you know, both your audience and your search engines are, like, what\u2019s that journey? So, to your point about hitting up those gaps and then ultimately making those kind of semantic connections for your audience to reduce the thinking and just almost predict where they\u2019re going to go for them. It seems like, yeah, it seems like that\u2019s exactly what you\u2019re thinking about for your clients and just yourself. Ross:  Yeah, exactly. And I mean, all that thought leadership content, sales enablement, I mean, thought leadership in particular, hopefully that will generate sharing links that will support SEO specifically. I mean, that\u2019s almost more of an organic growth tip, but that\u2019s sort of where my head\u2019s running at this moment. So I mean, I have no doubt doing all those things will drive eventual search performance as well. Garrett : And that leads right into kind of my final question, which is like, as you\u2019re thinking more about just organic growth holistically and the way that we\u2019re thinking about SEO and content, what is the next chapter of search from your perspective? Like, where do you see all this going? How should we be thinking about it? Ross:  I mean, yeah, it\u2019s going to, I think it\u2019s going to be harder. I do think the channel is going to shrink a little bit. I think going up-market generally is smart. I mean, if you\u2019re a small business owner listening to this, that\u2019s not great news, but I think the big players are going to win naturally. So supporting them as an SEO is probably a smart thing for our careers generally. So, I think that\u2019s a good idea. So, kind of getting in front of that, and that in turn, those companies also are in the best position to do the other things productively like the organic growth, thought leadership. They have the audience and the traffic such that you could just put that in the site architecture and they can do productive things with that content, which may be a zero, day-zero startup. Well, unfortunately just not. They need some kind of base in traffic to kind of get value out of that, unfortunately. Garrett : Do you think Google will do a better job of surfacing thought leadership, or do you think other channels will continue to be like just the focus for when you\u2019re creating that content? Ross:  I mean, we\u2019ve created big process docs for it, and to get our team thinking about it, I don\u2019t say this is for search, like don\u2019t look for keywords but of all the distribution ideas, I did put it at the very end. Like, don\u2019t start with a keyword this thing could rank for. I know, I think Bernard of ClearScope had some posts on this, so like there is sometimes room on search results for like a counter-take, and not all thought leadership needs to be like, \u201cthis is wrong.\u201d It just means like, how does my product fit into this idea in a way that we\u2019re positioned to do that? I don\u2019t think it has to be some like super aggressive angry take necessarily. Might be the positioning a lot. If you do that, yeah, I think there is potential to get shown on search, but it\u2019s more so that may be more likely to create brand \u2013 that will contribute to you showing up on search. And then if you show up on search on those other, like through other articles, then they\u2019ll find your thought leadership adjacent to it, like in your navigation-related linking. And you can be smart about other things like include influencers and still promote it on social. And you have an email newsletter, hopefully. Things all that should be additive enough to definitely warrant doing this stuff. Garrett : Yeah, it\u2019s so interesting. It\u2019s such a different equation in terms of visibility and market share. And the other big question we\u2019re all thinking about is like, will this ultimately be surfaced through the conversational platforms? Like whether they\u2019re adopted or not, to what extent will that, I mean, you mentioned brand. Brand just seems to be the kind of resounding answer for the future of content in general. Ross:  Yeah, I mean, it\u2019s the most future-proof. We can kind of be future, current state on these things. And even current state seems to be pretty brand rewarding generally, but it seems pretty defensible long-term to have a defensible brand that lives outside of these things. And if we contribute to that, it seems like search is going to be rewarded too. Garrett : I love it. So, I mean, I\u2019m always bullish on content. You create good content, you build your brand, you\u2019re going to be found.

How MUM processes multimedia, multi-step queries, and cross-language content Why traditional keyword strategies don\u2019t align with how MUM structures information What changes brands should make to optimize for AI-driven, contextual search \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t \n\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t Transcript \t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t \n\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t Garrett : All right, welcome back to The Next Chapter of Search produced by SEO week and iPullRank \u2013 if you haven\u2019t bought your tickets: New York City, April 28, we are going to have 35+ of the like most brilliant expert speakers in the world talking about everything from data, SEO, AI, content, digital marketing, you name it. And today I am so excited because I am joined by one of my favorite people, Miss Cindy Krum. Cindy is the founder and CEO of mobile Moxie. How you doing Cindy? What\u2019s going on? Cindy : I\u2019m fantastic. How are you? It\u2019s good to see you. Garrett : It\u2019s great to see you. I\u2019m so excited to check because like we have so many discussions about the future of search and we\u2019ll get to that. But to dive in before we jump into the future, I want to ask you what you\u2019ve been seeing. Where are we in the state of SEO from your perspective right now? Cindy : Oh my gosh. So I think like the state of SEO is mirroring the state of other things as well because it\u2019s feels chaotic and a bit unpredictable and a bit dirty, honestly, like it feels a bit corrupt. And I\u2019ve been saying that for a while, but it feels like now that\u2019s not going to get better. Now that\u2019s probably going to get worse. People are going to double down on making the most money that they can. And that\u2019s not necessarily good for SEOs. And I don\u2019t want to-I know I\u2019m not probably supposed to get political, so I\u2019ll stop there. But even keeping anything like that out of it, like when a company has been proven to be a monopoly and they double down and don\u2019t stop being a monopoly, like you have to wonder why. And some of the things that Google\u2019s been testing with AI overviews, and I don\u2019t know if you saw, but the test with the AI overview with 30 links and like a full-page AI overview, I think that\u2019s where it\u2019s going. And I think that makes SEO so much harder. Garrett : Yeah. Oh my goodness. There\u2019s so much to unpack there. And I can\u2019t wait to have more of these conversations, like the whole idea of AI mode. That\u2019s what we thought in the first place was like, it was going to be Gemini. And it seems like that is what we\u2019re seeing to some extent. So you look at all of the algorithms, the updates, the LLMs, MUM is your jam. Can you give us a little bit of a preview on what you\u2019re talking about in SEO week and why should people come and learn from you? Cindy : Yeah. So MUM is super powerful. If you remember kind of the AI and language processing models, BERT came before MUM and MUM was a thousand times stronger than BERT. And BERT was about bi-directional transformers, right? This word can modify this word and means different things before and after and stuff like that. MUM is a thousand times stronger and MUM stands for multitask unified model, which is basically a meaningless series of words, unless you\u2019re an AI developer. But what it breaks down to mean, and what we first saw it mean was like, I was constantly misspeaking and saying like, instead of multitask, I would say multimedia or I would say them both together because it seemed like MUM was related to multimedia. And a lot of multimedia algorithmic search capabilities came out right after the launch of MUM. But now with the benefit of seeing and experiencing Gemini and AI overviews, you can see the power of MUM because the multitaskness is potentially like for users, like, or potentially maybe they just meant that it was on the processing side, but either way, what we\u2019re seeing is more comprehensive search results that are more tailored to a specific search context. So, let\u2019s think about it on the search side. Multitask might be not just understanding the words but understanding the words in the context of a journey, and that\u2019s what the MUM announcement talked about. And, so, if you take the step to one, understand the words and then two, understand the journey, that\u2019s already multitask. But then when you understand like the nature of a journey, a journey is multitask. You don\u2019t finish a journey in one step, right? And, so, it\u2019s this idea of they\u2019re doing multiple steps because they know you\u2019re going to be doing multiple steps. And, so, they want to give you the steps that are the most meaningful in your particular search context. And, so, you know, understanding journeys and not just keywords is kind of the evolution. So, we had keywords, then we had entities, and now we have journeys. And so, think about like one keyword can represent multiple entities perhaps, and one entity can represent multiple journeys. And, so, think of this as like a blossoming thing where Google\u2019s just getting smarter and smarter, right? Garrett : Yeah. And I think in terms of like all of the data they have to that point, Google, it\u2019s scary to think how much they can predict that journey and that to some extent, that\u2019s what they\u2019re trying to do. But not to go too down the rabbit hole, there\u2019s always the following the money and their limitations in terms of, like, resources and what\u2019s cost prohibitive of going down the journey, which I know we can talk about when I want to ask you about what\u2019s next in search. But first, do you have like a practical takeaway, a practical something that listeners can do right now to SEO to kind of either future proof or optimize their websites and content? Cindy : Yeah. So, the actionable thing to do is similar to what we\u2019ve always done in SEO, which is to see what\u2019s working and what\u2019s showing up at the top of a search result. So, we used to just see what websites were there and then we would see what featured snippets were there and kind of try and mirror that or do something like that, have the same search signals as those things. Now what we do is we look at those also and we look at what\u2019s in AI overviews and stuff like that. But if there are filter pills at the top of your search result, that\u2019s how I really kind of understand what Google is understanding about a journey. So, when Google launched MUM, they talked about Mount Fuji and you can do searches about Mount Fuji in a number of contexts. It might be artistic painting and something like that. It might be for a hike. It might be for weather or for historical context or anything like that. But if you search for Mount Fuji, Google is going to start kind of front running assumptions about what you\u2019re going to want next. And knowing what those assumptions are, the easiest way to do that is to do the search and see what shows up in those filter pills because it\u2019ll start to kind of add modifiers to your search for you so that it can say Mount Fuji and hiking or Mount Fuji and weather. And, so, you don\u2019t even have to type; you can just click the filter bubble. And that\u2019s great for users, but it\u2019s also like it\u2019s giving you the mind map of what Google knows on that entity. Garrett : I love that. I\u2019ve also been thinking about that a lot. I\u2019m sure you could speak a lot to the idea of like as we\u2019re seeing more AI organized search results. So, like those carousels where they have the subtopics and that\u2019s like another clue like the filters. CIndy : Yeah, absolutely. Absolutely. Like how? So we have to think about like how is Google trying to meet the needs of the user and why? And so not just looking at what\u2019s ranking, but looking at like the specific websites or whatever, but classifying those and saying, you know, is this informative? Is this, um, you know, yeah. Helpful? Is Google presenting it in one context or another? And believe it or not, in my talk, I\u2019m going to go back to some, uh, something way back in SEO. Like someone told me that this is a trigger word for them, but the micro-moments of search is something that Google started talking about, uh, years and years ago. And what I figured out is that Google stopped talking about it. And I think it was, they stopped talking about it because it was showing their hand too much, right? It was too clear because when you go back and you look at the micro-moments of, uh, search, it\u2019s, I want to know, I want to go, I want to do, I want to buy. And that breaks down into the four ways that Google is monetizing search results right now. So, I want to know is the regular Google search result. I want to go is a map search result, which is newly monetized and, you know, integrated with merchant center and whatever, whatever with ads and all these things. Um, I want to, I want to know, I want to go, I want to buy. Obviously we\u2019ve seen crazy merchant center and shopping search results and then Google product knowledge graph. And then, uh, the other one is I want to do, that\u2019s the tough one because that is, it\u2019s not as intuitive until you figure out until you reverse it. And you\u2019re like, well, what else is Google showing a lot of in the search result? And it\u2019s like, Oh, duh. YouTube, right? YouTube is where people do things. They learn things, they watch videos, they research things like they\u2019re researching products, they\u2019re watching influencers and Google\u2019s monetized the crap out of YouTube and Google sucks you into like you\u2019re the Google or the YouTube hole where you never get out. If you let the videos auto-play, like, you know, you\u2019re stuck there forever and they\u2019re monetizing forever and they love that. Garrett : It makes a lot of sense and I think about that a lot in just the multimodal, it comes back to, you know, video in general, but what\u2019s, what\u2019s next? What is, what are you thinking is going to happen with Google, with the general like search ecosystem? How are you thinking about things? Cindy : I think Google is going to hone their monetization of each of those micro-moments into something better. So YouTube, I think we\u2019re seeing a lot of things rolled into YouTube. Maps were rolled into YouTube, music is now like semi-YouTube. And so they\u2019re, they\u2019ve kind of messed up the YouTube ecosystem by adding all these things and it\u2019s kind of messy over there. Maybe they\u2019ll sort that out, but they kind of don\u2019t care as long as they\u2019re monetizing. I think maps is a big opportunity for Google to do better. Those search results, you know, there\u2019s room for improvement and there\u2019s room for more monetization there. I think from Google\u2019s perspective. And I think we may see Google try and do a move where they\u2019re getting deeper into small business pockets of like, how can they make more money there and, and act like they\u2019re helping small businesses. And, and, you know, I\u2019m so jaded at this point, I should probably put a better spin on it. Maybe I\u2019ll reverse it and I\u2019ll say, listen, Google\u2019s going to try and help small businesses a lot more and it\u2019s not going to be free, but it\u2019s going to be helpful probably, you know? Garrett : Yeah, yeah. It\u2019s, it\u2019s, it\u2019s existential. I mean, and like, you know, you, like you, it\u2019s hard to think about how it ultimately plays out. Like at one point, does it actually hurt Google to do things this way versus ultimately continue to feed their pockets and, and, and continue to get them more revenue? I feel like they\u2019re riding a fine line with their product. Cindy : They really are. And maybe it\u2019s less obvious in countries outside of the US because remember, we still get things first a lot of the time. And so maybe it just feels more pernicious here. Or like I said, maybe I\u2019m just jaded. That\u2019s fair too. Cause I\u2019ve been in this industry for a long time. And I remember when it was like the, the young, you know, free love hippie days of SEO where like we just got 10 blue links and you got the traffic and you\u2019re, you know. Garrett : No, I mean, back in the, back in the hippie days is also when you were, had people putting like the white text on a white background and doing all sorts of hacks they could to manipulate the system, which still possible. I, if you guys want to have a conversation with Cindy, you got to come to SEO week. We are going to have so many fun, like deep dives into what we think is happening. Every time is fantastic.

And iPullRank I\u2019m Garrett Sussman. If you haven\u2019t already gotten your tickets, New York City, April 28th to May 1st, we are going to have 35+ of the most amazing speakers in our industry across SEO, data, AI, content, you name it. And I am joined by a brilliant individual himself. I\u2019m excited to be joined by JR Oakes, who is the VP of Strategy at Locomotive, this amazing agency that does everything across the board. Thanks for joining me today, JR, appreciate you, man. JR:  Glad to be here, man. Garrett : What is going on with SEO? Like the whole industry has been in flux for the last 12 months, 24 months, 10 years, if you will. From your perspective, what is the current state of search? JR:  I think that Google has been trying to solve the content issue for the last couple of years, and I don\u2019t think they\u2019re there. I think content is 10xing right now with all of the generative tools. I can\u2019t watch or read LinkedIn anymore because every tool there is how to 10x your content strategy. And at some point, I think that becomes a zero-sum game. I think we see Google moving away from a lot of the traditional 10 blue links and into like walls of content, walls of products, walls of images, walls of social and discussion boards and trying to go where kind of real conversation is happening instead of this 10x content. So, I think we\u2019ll continue to see this. I think Google has been lifting up like traditional brands, but I think that\u2019s somewhat of a fallacy. It\u2019s like Craftsman. Craftsman used to be known for like the tools that were like the best quality and everything. And then now it\u2019s some brand bought them up and then it\u2019s putting the Craftsman name on there and it\u2019s not the same quality, right? But to Google, it\u2019s like, I think they would see Craftsman and say, oh, this is a really good tool brand. So, let\u2019s give them some quality for tools, but it\u2019s really not. There\u2019s a brand effect there, but I don\u2019t think they\u2019ve gotten, I think they\u2019re still having those issues like they have with Wire\u2013 not Wirecutter, but some of the, I would say the kind of the add-on coupon code content sites that they have for- Garrett : Reputation abuse. JR:  Yeah, reputation abuse. So, I think they\u2019re still working on that. I think they\u2019ve gone hard in the direction back to allowing AI content after kind of smashing a lot of that for a while. And that\u2019s a little scary, but I don\u2019t know, we\u2019ll see. We\u2019re all kind of spectators here from Google\u2019s perspective. Garrett : From your perspective, exactly. Do you think Google, do you think, because it\u2019s so easy to both overestimate them and underestimate them. Do you think they know what they\u2019re doing, or do you think they\u2019ve lost the plot? JR:  I don\u2019t, either Google is, Google just feels like they\u2019re messing everything up. And I\u2019ll give you an example. Like they\u2019ve been building this Vertex AI thing for the last two years and I\u2019ve watched it. I looked at it a couple of years ago and it\u2019s this whole search and convert thing, right? On their platform where you can put in a website and it uses Google search to search it and pull snippets. And it\u2019s a grounding thing for Google search. And then it also had things where it would like watch users through the site and just a lot of really cool tools. That thing has been renamed like three times in the last two years and new UX applied. Like you can\u2019t even go back month over month and expect the same experience or the same tool or the same anything there. So, I feel like they\u2019re just like trying to do everything and they\u2019re not doing like anything like really well. The Gemini stuff is fine. It\u2019s, I\u2019d never use it for really anything. They still have search. What is it? The deep search on Gemini 1.5, which that doesn\u2019t make sense. I don\u2019t know. I don\u2019t know what Google\u2019s doing, but it\u2019s not winning right now. Garrett : And as more people use it, it kind of leads into your whole presentation SEO Week where you\u2019re going to be talking about brand discoverability on these LLMs. You mentioned the brand, you mentioned the LLMs. Can you kind of give a preview of how you\u2019re thinking about things? Why should people come and check out your presentation? JR:  Well, I\u2019ve heard a lot and I\u2019ve seen a lot of tools that are like getting, trying to apply like the same paradigm of search to language models. And I just don\u2019t think that\u2019s there. I think there\u2019s a lot of reasons why language models need to be kind of treated differently, right? Because you have deep search, you have search, you have memory, you have people that have put direct, specific directions in the back of language models. And a lot of this information that traditional search doesn\u2019t have, right? So, thinking about, oh, my brand came first versus second, like I think it\u2019s just insane to kind of think that like that with language models, where I thought, what we tried to do is really look at a specific niche, which is a lot of kind of more B2B SaaS companies, but also look at it from a brand perspective and a brand discovery perspective. So, if I\u2019m a user and I go and I search \u201cbest CRM provider\u201d in ChatGPT, Anthropic, Google versus\u2013 or Gemini versus Google search, like what is the experience of that? Like what brands am I shown, right? And we did that across, I think, thousands of keywords. And then we\u2019re also looking at specific modifiers. So, we have, I think around 30 to 35 different modifiers, like best, top, enterprise, SME, a ton more, GDPR compliant, right? Bunch of those, like, yeah, different modifiers that are classed out. So, we\u2019re going to be looking at it, not only across like distinct industries, but also looking at it across those different modifiers. And then also taking more of a temporal aspect to it of going back in time and saying, okay, what\u2019s changed with the first GPT 3.5 versus GPT 4.5, right? So, we\u2019re also looking at, I think, 17 or 18 different models and historically in search results to kind of look at what changed, but really putting that, thinking about I\u2019m going and I\u2019m searching for this type of software provider on a language model versus I\u2019m going to Google. And then what is the brand discovery experience there, right? And looking at it just from that lens, not a ranking experience. Garrett : I love that because it\u2019s really hard. I think a lot of people are trying to understand the complexity. And we always, one thing I keep coming back to is this idea of like, we want precision when we just really have to focus on general accuracy at this point. Like precision\u2019s kind of out the door, not that we ever really had it, but with these, it\u2019s gone. JR:  Yeah, I mean, I think it\u2019s interesting though. We\u2019ve already seen some interesting things like just how much more brands are being exposed now versus in some of the earlier models. It\u2019s like in some cases, like two to three times, more brands coming back from the same type of search results and still like some sites that just dominate all models. And one of the cool things that I think, and this is Robert Paget on our team said is that, I think one of the most interesting thing is the AI categories, right? Because AI categories have been around for the last like year or two, right? So, we\u2019re actually seeing them from infancy to growth and it\u2019s not these like established brands like Red Hat, IBM, these companies have been around forever. We\u2019re seeing their like growth and their content growth and then coming about. So, we can kind of use language models and use some of this data to kind of see what they\u2019re doing, right? What are companies that have been around like less than a year doing and showing language models and Google and what are the kind of the differences there? And I think that\u2019s really cool because I think that gets you to more kind of tactical actions that we can say this person did this and they\u2019re winning in this category for this reason, right? So, I think that\u2019s cool. Garrett : I think, and it leads right into, I\u2019m curious, do you have one, speaking of tactical, like one tactical thing that people can do right now, that you\u2019re going to expand upon in your presentation, but what\u2019s like based on your research, what\u2019s something that folks can do this moment? JR:  I would create a brand reviews page. I think that is the lowest of lowest hanging fruit because on Google you have, I did a thing a few years ago about like, is like Google, like the PAA questions, like is Google legit or is Apple legit? And Apple, I mean, Google had like, \u201cwhy is Apple a bad company\u201d showing up in those? And I was like, you\u2019re kind of forcing people into an opinion there based on some of these, but you have so many of those, like I hear about this product or service and then I\u2019m going to go and say, all right, let me search them and see kind of what they\u2019re all about. Right? And then you have is this service any good or reviews or reputation type queries about companies. And that\u2019s big on search. It\u2019s also big on language models, right? And the thing about it is, is that you can, if you have a, I don\u2019t know, a, a traffic reviews page and somebody says, is a trust any good, they\u2019re RAG models and search is going to pull out that page. So, you must assuredly have a voice in how you\u2019re perceived there. And Google does, I mean, the language model doesn\u2019t know whether it\u2019s real. I mean, I guess they would know what\u2019s your site, right? But I don\u2019t know whether they\u2019ll have that presence of mind. They\u2019ll just be like, oh, this company is like really amazing because they have, you know, five stars on Yelp and this and this and this and all these testimonials. Right? It\u2019s the easiest of easy, have low hanging fruit there, I would say. Garrett : I love it. Because it does very much, especially with LLMs as search engines feels like a wild, wild West where so many of these older techniques currently work and you have like a ChatGPT that\u2019s not thinking about it with the same sort of algorithmic parameters and ranking signals and all that you\u2019re saying about like authority and trust. It just doesn\u2019t necessarily apply. I guess it\u2019s somewhat dependent on Bing\u2019s index but that\u2019s still volatile. I feel like we don\u2019t know what ChatGPT is doing. Dude, so what\u2019s next JR? Like, what do you anticipate is the next indication of search? You\u2019re talking about a little bit but where do you think we\u2019re going? JR:  I think the packaging and the accessibility of search gets better. You have the demos teased with ChatGPT or with open AI about having that model where you have your phone with you and they\u2019re kind of interacting with the environment. You have Project Astra from Google, you have Lens, you have this multimodal experience, right? So obviously at some point, you know you\u2019re going to have an experience where you\u2019re like putting up your phone and it\u2019s like I want to redo my kitchen, right? And then there\u2019s this interactive experience. I feel like the packaging and accessibility of search gets a lot more really interesting over time. I think that the value proposition between content creators, written content creators and search engines and LLMs will be kind of refactored because you can\u2019t have people 10Xing or creating 12,000 pieces of content a year. And you can\u2019t have agents that are visiting websites and kind of not seeing ads or not giving the creators back anything. You can\u2019t have those and that exists for a long period of time without some kind of really big change. So those are the barriers I would say I would say are pretty ripe for change. Garrett:  I, and who knows, maybe that\u2019s a good thing. It\u2019s like once content creation is not just about visibility in organic search channels and more in other places, the quality improves. And like, then it\u2019s on the LLMs to figure out like the AI generated crap versus like actually authentic content that wasn\u2019t necessarily designed for them. JR:  Yeah, well, I think the detail has to get really good. Right, like the 99% will be like covered well by language models and search engines. And it\u2019s that 1% that I think has to get really great. Garrett:  Well, there you go. I have so many brilliant things. I can\u2019t wait to have more conversations with you. But for those of you who have not already bought your tickets for SEO Week, April 28th to May 1st in New York City, come chat about the future and the ridiculousness of LLMs with JR, myself and all the other brilliant SEOs and developers and data scientists and content creators that are going to be there. Thanks so much for joining me, JR. I really appreciate your time, man. JR:  Yeah, looking forward to this conference. Garrett:  It\u2019s going to be huge. See you then.

We are hyped, we got another one of our killer presenters that I\u2019m talking to today, Crystal Carter. Crystal is the head of SEO communications at Wix Studio. Thanks for joining me today, Crystal. What is up? Crystal : Everything is up. Things are changing. Things are changing and growing and becoming new and kind of still the same again. Garrett : You are in the weeds and I\u2019m really excited to see what you\u2019ve been unearthing for your presentation. But before we get to what you\u2019ll be presenting about, let\u2019s dive in. Yeah, okay. State of SEO, like you said, lots of things are happening. From your perspective, what is the state of our industry? Like, what are you looking at right now? Crystal : If I\u2019m completely honest, I think SEO is in beta mode right now. We are in one of the most transformational times the industry has seen in years. And I think that the way that we\u2019ve done SEO traditionally, well, I don\u2019t think that you should throw it out. I think that it\u2019s something that we need to evolve, and we need to evolve now. And people say, \u201cIs SEO dead?\u201d And I\u2019m like, \u201cNo, but it is changing.\u201d And if you are still doing SEO the way that you were doing it five years ago, then you\u2019re going to struggle, if I\u2019m completely honest. And I think that anybody who\u2019s still doing checklists and just expecting to collect a check, like they might struggle to get the results that they were seeing before, and they might even struggle to sell it to folks in terms of like clients and the C-suite, etc. etc. So I think that right now is a great time to pick up some new skills. Right now is a great time to be testing and iterating and paying attention to new opportunities in SEO. And right now is a great time to be talking to other channels as well. And I think that it\u2019s still valuable. It still adds value for users. And we\u2019re able to build on these skills, but we can\u2019t just rely just on the traditional skills that we\u2019ve had. Garrett : I love that. Can I ask you specifically, why do you think it\u2019s changing? Can you kind of like dig into like, what is changing that the old tactics don\u2019t work? Crystal : Google\u2019s not the only game in town. If I need an answer to a question, I could go to Google. I could go to Perplexity. I could go to Claude. I could go to Copilot. I could go to Chat GPT. And many, many users are. If you look at the user uptake for these tools, Perplexity is adding like 10 million users or something every couple of months. And they\u2019re lower down. Chat GPT is pulling in around like 87, 90-ish percent of the LLM tool use across the industry. And they have billions. I think we\u2019re approaching 3 billion or more users every month. And it continues to grow. And at that pace, if you are still relying exclusively on Google, then you are missing out on a large number of people who are coming through. And there\u2019s studies coming out regularly about how leads are really good coming from Chat GPT, for instance, and the links are being more consistent. And there\u2019s tools that are developing around this all the time. And we need to be guiding those things. I think for a while, people were saying, oh, SEO is dead. And Gartner said, oh, search is going to drop by 26%. And all of that sort of stuff. And SEOs were like, oh no, but we\u2019re not helpless. Like, we ruined the internet. We can do anything. So I think that we have tools. And I think that we previously have thought about like crawlability, indexability, rankability. And we now need to think about like retrievability. We need to think about that next element so that we can stay relevant for the brands that we\u2019re working for across every stage of the user journey. And that LLM portion has to be part of the user journey. Garrett : I love it. Oh man, retrievability is such like, we\u2019re going to be hearing so much more about that, especially in the context of retrieval augmented generation, the way that these LLMs work. Speaking of which, what are you talking about at SEO week? Like give us a little bit of a preview as you formulate your presentation of what people can expect if they attend in New York. Crystal : I think a lot of people are pontificating about how you can rank and how you can optimize for LLMs. And I will be presenting my findings and my observations and the things that I\u2019ve seen that seem to work. And I have been looking at this space for a while. I think I first got really interested in it because like everybody else, when ChatGPT sort of first blew up, I said, \u201cHey ChatGPT, who\u2019s Crystal Carter?\u201d And they gave me the Mariah Carey meme where she goes, \u201cI don\u2019t know her.\u201d They gave me that. They were like, \u201cI don\u2019t know who she is.\u201d And I was like, \u201cCool, I\u2019ll just, yeah, thanks, awesome.\u201d And then a few months later I tried it again and they did know who I was. And I was like, \u201cThat\u2019s very interesting. What\u2019s happened between then and now? And that really got me, really got all the gears going. And I think that we\u2019re in a really, really interesting space in the last four or five months, we\u2019ve seen search GPT blow up. We\u2019ve seen links becoming more commonplace on Gemini. They\u2019re a bit up and down with whether or not they have links all the time, but they\u2019re in there. And, you know, Copilot on 365 has links as well. And Perplexity continues to grow and is a fantastic tool if I don\u2019t say so. And I think that the way that we position our brands in those tools is absolutely within the wheelhouse of an SEO because all of those search-enabled LLMs have a search engine at the back of them to ground them so that they have more accurate information and to give them more detail. Perplexity recently opened up, you know, they have DeepSeek and you can see the reasoning. It shows you all of the steps that it takes to give you an answer. And it shows which websites they reference. It shows which pages they go to. It shows all of those elements and you can see that. And you can see how it connects through to whether your brand is referenced and whether your brand is visible. And I think that we can take all of the skills that we have from understanding how crawl bots work, from understanding how keywords work, from understanding, you know, how users find information. We have years of knowledge across that. And even understanding how SaaS is developed is valuable. And I think we can take all of those skills and I think we can apply that to driving brand visibility within these LLMs. And I hope to be able to share some of that. Garrett : Oh my goodness. It\u2019s so much fun because it really does feel like a wild, wild West where we\u2019re like, you know, ChatGPT, we don\u2019t know the extent to which it completely depends on Bing and it\u2019s like algorithmic ranking signals, whatever. And to what extent it\u2019s even building its own. Perplexity is very much a black box and there are all these platforms for us to figure out. From your experiments up until this point, what is one practical, actionable thing that people can start doing right now to improve their visibility? Crystal : If you are using a search-enabled web builder or sorry, search-enabled LLM, then you need to give feedback on inaccurate responses. And you need to give feedback very clearly. And it\u2019s something that they all ask for. If you look up the Gemini information, it will say, give us feedback on all of our information. Let us know what\u2019s going on. If you see inaccurate information, like verifiably inaccurate, like if it says that like, the CEO of Betty Crocker is Kim Kardashian, you can go, no, it is not. And you could go thumbs down and give them feedback. And that will give you results. And when you check it again, it will be more accurate. And that\u2019s something that anyone can do regardless of any tool set. Garrett : Oh my goodness, that\u2019s so good. I mean, I haven\u2019t heard enough people actually recommend just go in and clicking that feedback. Great tip. Now, what\u2019s next, Crystal? Like the whole SEO, there\u2019s so many directions and nobody knows definitively, but what direction do you think SEO will be going for the next stage of search? Crystal : I think that the act of optimizing for LLMs is something that is going to be core to SEO within the next element or sort of the next few years, because the use of LLMs and the use of chat, chat, you know, sorry, generative search and those chat bots and those chat assistants is only going to increase. So, we need to make sure that we have brand visibility across those things. What I think is really interesting is how we\u2019re going to do that. I hear a lot of people who are like, skyscraper content is over. And I\u2019m like, I mean, maybe, but actually what people forget is that those large language models need language, they need words in order to model their responses. So if you don\u2019t have content on your brand that\u2019s talking about what you do, then there\u2019s nothing for them to use to model their responses on you. And if somebody else is writing on it, then guess what? That will be the information that shows on there. So I don\u2019t necessarily think that skyscraper content is over. Also, there\u2019s so many tools like Notebook LM, which I just absolutely love. Notebook LM will take that skyscraper post and then it becomes the knowledge base for whatever thing the person\u2019s working on. And if you have a comprehensive piece of content on whatever topic, then that\u2019s something that they can use to reference and they can use it as information. And that\u2019s incredibly, incredibly valuable for a brand. So I think that we are going to have to rethink what content is for and what it does for a brand. And I think we\u2019re also going to need to rethink how and why we take the steps that we do. So link building is still important, but where? It\u2019s not just link building for the sake of link building, not just quantity\u2019s sake, but being strategic about which links are going to actually move you forward in the conversation around the particular topic. We can think about clustering, of course, but that needs to be thought about in terms of like how that flows with the user journey that somebody might have on an LLM, for instance, about whatever your topic is. So I think that we are going to need to evolve our tools to not just be, you know, just Google and just the plain blue links. And I think, you know, we might have to, you know, just accept the plain blue links maybe aren\u2019t the only game in town, though we have loved them for a long time, they have served us well. You know, there\u2019s other fish that we can go after. And I think that we need to evolve with some of those things and maybe not hold so tightly to some of the things that have, you know, done us so well in the past. Garrett : I love it. It\u2019s so interesting. It\u2019s just so much a mental shift. A lot of stuff is the same, you know, relevance, authority, even user behavior still matters. It\u2019s just the way that it\u2019s going to be discovered is going to change the way that people interact. Crystal, thank you so much. For those of you who haven\u2019t already got your ticket, we\u2019re talking April 28th to May 2nd, New York City.

I am so excited. Remember, if you haven\u2019t already, get your tickets for April 28th to May 2nd in New York City. We are going to have over 36, 37, 38 of the best speakers in our industry and I am joined by one today. I\u2019m joined by Will Critchlow, who is the founder and CEO at SearchPilot. Thanks for joining me today, Will. How you doing, man? Will:  I\u2019m doing great, Garrett, and very much looking forward to a trip to New York City. So yeah, looking forward to that. Garrett : We were just saying, and it\u2019s going to be so fun to be able to converse with all these brilliant minds. There\u2019s so much happening in our industry. You are very much doing tons of experimentation, tons of testing. From your perspective, what is the current state of SEO? Will:  I\u2019m excited about the current state of SEO. I know there\u2019s a lot of noise and a lot of change. I have been having a lot of conversations recently about what folks are thinking in terms of, obviously, the impact of AI and large language models and the startups, the ChatGPTs of the world, but also how Google is using that tech. And I\u2019ve got a bit of a kind of now, next, and later framework around that and more of that at SEO Week. But my view on the now, just to kind of, it ties directly into what you\u2019re saying there, is Google is the AI discovery channel right now. There\u2019s very exciting growth in all these other tools, but the two things to realize are Google is  huge , orders of magnitude bigger than everybody else, and AI-powered. And I think it\u2019s that second point that has perhaps been underappreciated in the industry is the move ever since \u2013 I date it to when Amit Singhal left in 2016, I think it was, and they kind of opened the floodgates on deep learning, as they called it at the time, in the organic algorithm. And ever since then, it\u2019s just been incrementally more and more and more. I was talking about it back then, but now we see it in our faces, front and center. And for me, that\u2019s particularly exciting because it aligns with the direction we\u2019ve been going of needing to test to figure out what really works in organic search. Just like the way that you\u2019ve always needed to test to figure out what humans like, the more complex and nuanced the preferences of the machines become, the more you can\u2019t just follow a checklist and say, well, they like it now. And you have to kind of say, I\u2019ve got a hypothesis and I\u2019m going to run an experiment. Garrett : I love it. And those are so much more dynamic. And we\u2019re even seeing over the past six to 12 months, this rollout of AI organized search results specifically for shopping. They have a whole new version of shopping, kind of segues right into what you are going to be presenting at SEO Week. Can you speak to what you\u2019re seeing, what you\u2019re thinking about, and why people should come and see you speak at the event? Will : Sure. So, I\u2019m going to be diving deep into e-commerce land. And so, yeah, shopping is a huge part of that, obviously, as in the shopping tab, but also the way that product information is getting incorporated in regular search results and the blending of organic and paid. And we\u2019ve got some new data, some new methodologies, some new discoveries, some tips and tricks that I\u2019m definitely going to be bringing for e-com and retail in general. And so, I\u2019m hoping it\u2019s going to be must-see, don\u2019t miss information for particularly those super- where we\u2019re specializing, the super large websites, really big e-com and retail brands. And yeah, for any folks who are specializing in those areas, I\u2019m hoping it\u2019ll be must-see content. Garrett : Oh man, I am so excited. And just as like a preview from all the research and experimentation you\u2019re doing, what is one practical, actionable thing that e-commerce brands can do right now to improve their visibility? Will : Well, so actually I\u2019m going to take it in a subtly different way. I definitely will be answering that question at the show. The thing I\u2019m going to give away right now is more of the next feature. So, I mentioned this kind of now, next and later kind of framework. The next piece is in my view, e-commerce and retail is one of the verticals where folks should be least scared and most excited about the AI revolution, whatever we want to call it. Because as long as humans are still consuming things, we don\u2019t just get a chip implant or a Ready Player One-kind of environment where we just believe we\u2019re happy, then people are still buying stuff and they\u2019re going to buy it from a retailer. Ultimately, they\u2019re not buying it from the LLM makers or from Google themselves. So, while discovery might change, it\u2019s an exciting and disruptive time for the retailers themselves. And to that end, my tips are twofold related to just future-proofing around the coming AI revolution, which is one is- both are about being visible. One is audit your robots.txt because a lot of folks are blocking the AI crawlers. And I think there are strong cases for doing that in some spaces, some sectors, but I don\u2019t think there\u2019s a case for doing it for most e-commerce and retail websites. So, if folks want to disagree with that, you can find me on Twitter and LinkedIn and I\u2019m always happy to have the debate, but have a look and check that you\u2019re letting in crawlers beyond Googlebot and the classic search crawlers. And the second piece is to kind of go back to where, I mean, I remember making this recommendation as a young SEO 20 some years ago is have a look at your JavaScript reliance, because there\u2019s been a ton of great research that has been coming out showing that most of the crawlers powering the AI tools, but where the crawlers aren\u2019t from an existing search engine, they are not executing JavaScript. So, if your content is invisible without JavaScript, it\u2019s invisible to the large language models. And as I say, that might be what you want in some sectors, but I don\u2019t think it is in e-commerce and retail. So those are kind of simple tips. We\u2019ll be getting deeper into the current, what works right now and some of the forward-looking pie in the sky stuff when we meet in New York. Garrett : I love that. And especially when you\u2019re thinking like big brands, we are not seeing, aside from Google, some of these big LLMs necessarily prioritize brands. So it\u2019s like a lot of these basics actually do need to be implemented in ways that they, you know, larger enterprise might\u2019ve gotten away from at different points. Now your framework, you have a later, can you tell me what\u2019s coming next from your, or what\u2019s coming later from your perspective on SEO? Will : For sure. So the sneak preview of this is I have, I\u2019ve tied this to the hypothesis. I don\u2019t know if folks are familiar with years and years ago, I remember Jeff Bezos, when he was purely Amazon-focused, before his, you know, rocketry days. He had this thing he used to say about Amazon as e-commerce retailers saying that \u201cwe know that customers want low prices and we know that they want fast delivery and we know that they want a vast selection of products on offer.\u201d And he basically said, \u201cI\u2019m betting those three things are going to be true 10 years from now, 20 years from now. Those are the things that are not changing. And I\u2019m going to build my business around that.\u201d And I think some of the equivalent for what Sundar has done in his time at Google is essentially a bet on freshness, completeness, and relevance. The bet for information is that you want to know the latest, you want to know that you\u2019re getting everything, and you want to know that it\u2019s the right stuff. And those things are not changing, right? In 10 years from now, that\u2019s still going to be true. The exact source, the exact modality of that might change. By the time, I believe, so my bet, the bet I\u2019m making at SearchPilot is by the time that the challenges, whether it be ChatGPT or Perplexity or whoever it might be, by the time they are genuine kind of channels that are big enough that we might need to test against them independently in the same way that we care about Google, as I said right now, they\u2019re going to have to be fresh, complete, and relevant. And the freshness in particular is the key thing. The fact that they\u2019re going to have to incorporate real-time information is what is going to enable us to run experiments against our visibility in those places. And they\u2019ll look like CRO experiments, right? They\u2019ll look like the kind of experiments that we run for humans or have run for humans for decades. And so, the, yeah, I guess the final point I would say, the way I\u2019m framing this is my thinking is that in the longer term future, and this is almost true now if you account Google, is before a person is likely to buy from you, a machine has to recommend you. And those machine preferences are looking more and more human-like and subtle and complex. And that\u2019s why, yeah, that\u2019s why I\u2019m all in on hypothesis-driven testing. Garrett : There you go. Oh my goodness. There\u2019s so many valuable things that, and that\u2019s the whole thing with your approach to all this, Will, is it\u2019s all actual. It\u2019s not just theory. It\u2019s all backed up by the experimentation. It\u2019s all things that you can do, which is just one easy reason to buy your ticket. So, if you want to see Will give this dynamic, really interesting future-focused presentation on e-commerce, the LLMs, and Google, please buy your ticket for SEO Week. My name is Garrett Sussman of iPullRank, and we\u2019ll see you in April.

If you haven\u2019t already got your tickets, we are talking April 28th to May 1st in New York City \u2013 like the best of the best. You know, we\u2019re talking information retrieval, SEO, AI, content, all that funny stuff. And I\u2019ve got one of the best in the business joining me today. I am talking to Jeff Coyle, who is the Head of Strategy at Siteimprove and the co-founder of Market Muse. What\u2019s going on, Jeff? How you doin, man. Jeff : I am so excited. I\u2019m so excited. I\u2019m originally from New Jersey. Oh, I just realized I have my New York Rangers Lego guy behind me. Garrett : Booooo! Jeff : And I am just so excited to be, you know, part of SEO week. I am just pumped. There\u2019s a couple people that are going to be speaking also that I haven\u2019t seen in a little bit. And, you know, just, just pumped for the effort. Garrett : It\u2019s going to be so much fun. I mean, you and I, like we geek out over this stuff so many times. You\u2019re, you\u2019re releasing so much brand new stuff. Let\u2019s dive right in because like we love just geeking out about this. So current state of SEO, from your experience being in the algorithms, building tools, looking at everything from AI overviews to just the way that Google search is evolving, where do we stand in our industry? Jeff : I think that there\u2019s a lot of validation, I think, with, with search engine optimization professionals and technical SEO pros that have been doing this for a while. It\u2019s like, yeah, they\u2019re finally doing the things that I, you know, that I\u2019ve been on my soapbox speaking about. It\u2019s, it\u2019s, you know, the transition and the evolution that the search engines have had to make to deal with a world where there\u2019s infinite content. And those evolution, they had to start thinking about things at a site level, at site section levels from different angles, because what do you do if you\u2019re a search engine and you have, there\u2019s an infinite supply. There\u2019s no more, it\u2019s no longer a sca- mediocre content is no longer a scarce resource. So they\u2019ve had to evolve how they show information. They\u2019ve had to evolve how far they go in exploring possible intents. And they\u2019ve had to really say, \u201cHey, you have to be excellent. You have to be differentiated.\u201d And so all of these kind of takeaways have to be done with science. You know, they have to be done with technology. They have to be done in ways that are scalable. And that\u2019s really the story of the last two or three years. It\u2019s the search engines getting ready for this, this world where they have to rethink the way that they tell us, tell us who wins. Right? Garrett : And they\u2019ve, and they\u2019ve been doing a lot of that and you\u2019ve been researching, which kind of leads perfectly into, can you give us kind of a preview of what you\u2019ll be speaking about? Like, why should people come to SEO week to hear Jeff speak? Jeff : Oh gosh. I am going to walk through kind of what I feel is the 101 and the 201 classes, you know, basics of information retrieval. So frequently teams or search engine optimization professionals or the marketing team is only thinking about these things in terms of what\u2019s ranking higher or the search algorithm, where there\u2019s so many layers of what it, what it takes to go from your actual query to a result. And there\u2019s data sources in play. There\u2019s, and those, and those items have evolved. And the way that manifests is really a redefinition of search results structures. And that\u2019s really where I want to focus because what I\u2019ve found is that when you have a general understanding of that, you can get religion quickly on how to actually treat this. And you know, Garrett, you know, this so commonly I\u2019m like, yep, they\u2019ve got the diagnosis close, but they can\u2019t tell you the treatment. Right? So in my case, I want to be able to help people get to the diagnosis so that they can understand the treatment. And in a lot of cases that involves them thinking differently about how they approach content, building content strategy, like actual content efforts that maybe they wouldn\u2019t have. And ensuring that they land the plane with quality, authority, excellence, and the great punchline there, and, you know, why they should go to the show is the punchline here is this type of approach brings teams together. This type of approach makes you part of the discussion with the editor, part of the discussion with the subject matter expert, where, you know, as you know, for many, many, many years, decades, it\u2019s always been about who gets the resources. And a lot of cases, the SEO loses. But now where the puck\u2019s going is a world where the teams that are the least siloed have a highest chance of winning. And that\u2019s really exciting for me. Garrett : I love it. You do such a good job of marrying like the extreme technical with that higher level business value and where the creativity plays into it. And to your point about the mindset shift, executives, marketing teams, all need to think about this differently, because it\u2019s not just those old metrics of, you know, just rankings and traffic. There\u2019s so much more you\u2019re talking about holistically. With that said, I mean, obviously people have to come and hear you to hear like the real the real magic there. But what is something that someone can do like right now, practically, that can implement kind of some of the things that you\u2019re thinking about? Jeff : You know, I have dozens of these, you know, these one things that people can do right now to influence it. And before this show, I was showing you how I\u2019m doing one thing tests to show how, you know, these things are impacting some of these various AI outcomes. But I think the most important one, and this is really easy to do, is to examine content and look to say, do I know I or does someone on my team\u2026or do I know somebody who would be able to willing to contribute? Do I know a way to provide unique differentiated value? Especially if I\u2019m ranking, maybe I\u2019m not ranking as well as I want, or maybe I\u2019m afraid of competitors\u2019 actions. Is there something that I can provide prominently and elegantly woven into the narrative of this page or as a secondary page? Is there something I can provide that\u2019s really unique, differentiated value? I want to get that on the page. I want to get that in the in the cluster of content. It\u2019s truly something that\u2019s only going to come from me. It\u2019s very protected from a competitive perspective. That\u2019s your one thing. Take a collection of content that\u2019s doing okay or not doing as well as you want. And think to yourself, what can I bring that is truly one of a kind, that\u2019s truly my unique knowledge that has some competitive protection? Watch what happens. Because today, that equals winning. Garrett : Absolutely. Because it\u2019s especially in like such a generative AI world, it\u2019s like anything human that is really, yeah, you nailed it. That unique aspect is what\u2019s going to actually matter and not just be copycat, which is going to be so much easier to copy. Jeff : Oh, yeah. And just to add, I know that, but a lot of people are like, \u201cOkay, Jeff, well, like, what? What are you talking about?\u201d Find a subject matter expert. I bet you your CEO knows something. Find the customer success person who talks to customers all day. If you\u2019re in B2B tech, could you do a data study and bring in some facts and some knowledge? It\u2019s not just about like the fact, oh, you know something that everybody\u2026it\u2019s not necessarily your opinion. The more I live in this world, the more I realize that the winning team is the one with a real point of view. And that\u2019s repeating over and over again. So how can I make sure my point of view comes through in the form of differentiation? That\u2019s an easy one thing to do before you go to New York City. Garrett : I love it. And you have a point of view. So like follow this guy for more of them. What\u2019s next, dude? So many directions that this whole industry can go in. Where do you see search, the greater ecosystem, Google, what\u2019s happening next? Jeff : Oh, gosh, I think that what we\u2019re aiming, what we\u2019re going to have is, I mean, there are some early data on this, but what you\u2019re going to see is that as people get more used to a response being anything from a really bad book report, that was what I used to call AI overviews, a really bad book report, all the way down to really detailed, amazing research, my expectation is that it\u2019s going to drive more overall use of these solutions. So the natural transition, there\u2019s going to be a transition from certain types of queries to conversational. However, overall, the overall interaction with these types of solutions as an absolute number is going to go through the roof because the ways that you can integrate them into your life become so much more amazing than just search for something, right? And so more users, more searching, more desire for quick answers, more desire for deep research, all of those things bode well for marketers, for content professionals, for experts. I\u2019ve said the subject matter expert has risen. They are the most important person in the room. And so she who collects the most subject matter experts wins is my vision for the future. Garrett : I love it. I love it. Because the real truth is the limitations are being knocked down in terms of our capabilities and the tools are going to let us do it. Thank you so much. So if you want to talk to Jeff, either one of our cool parties afterwards, or check out his amazing presentation, get your ticket, New York City SEO week, end of April the 28th. We are so excited to see you there. Thanks again, Jeff. Jeff : If you\u2019re going if you\u2019re going LinkedIn me, DM me, Twitter/X me Jeffrey_Coyle, get in touch before I am. I\u2019m ready. I\u2019m ready to be in New York City. It\u2019s 18 degrees in Atlanta, Georgia right now. So I\u2019m ready to be anywhere but here right now, fingers crossed end of April will be nice weather. Garrett : No, it should be. We will see you there. My name is Garrett signing off. \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t \n \n\t \n\t\t\t \n \n \n\t \n \n\t \t\t \n\t \t\t\t \n\t\t\tRelated Posts\t\t\t

I am so excited. If you haven\u2019t already gotten your tickets, we\u2019re talking end of April the 28th to May 1st, New York City. We have 40 amazing speakers across SEO, data, AI, content, digital strategy, you name it. Check it out. Today I\u2019m joined by Mr. Prolific, been doing it forever and he is like deep, deep, deep into AI right now. I\u2019m joined by Wil Reynolds, who\u2019s the founder and CEO at SEER Interactive. What is up Wil? How you doing man? Wil:  I\u2019m having a wonderful morning. Garrett : Dude, it is a fun time to be an SEO, to be in AI. Things are nuts, but last 12 to 24 months have been nuts. What\u2019s your perspective on the current state of search? Wil:  I think search is screwed. I think answers are alive and well. So I think if you have branded yourself as a search person and a search optimizer, then you have attached your ego and your kudos, your image, yourself image to \u201cI optimize for search.\u201d If you have attached yourself to, \u201cI want to help people find answers,\u201d it\u2019s a great time to be alive. Because then I\u2019m not trying to defend randomly SEO or search engine stuff or looking for data points that go, \u201csee, people are still searching!\u201d It\u2019s like, nah, like it\u2019s like\u2013 I think in certain verticals, because it\u2019s the other thing. Searching data or like, I\u2019m seeing so much difference between verticals on how much people are or not adopting AI. It\u2019s a great time because you\u2019re playing the bet with your client and being like, how do I track this to see when that number gets big enough that we should pay attention. But the numbers are actually telling me that that AI chain ain\u2019t where your people are at right now. So let\u2019s not invest and let\u2019s just do SEO the way we\u2019re supposed to do it. But then let\u2019s be prepared for it and set up the early warning signals.  That  is where I think we all should have been from the beginning. And I\u2019m looking forward to that being the destination where we end up. And I think SEOs could be the right people to be there, but I\u2019m not sure we\u2019re going to be the right people to end up there. Garrett : I freaking love it because it\u2019s a mindset shift. We\u2019re so used to framing it one way. We have to think more expansively, which kind of leads right into your whole perspective and your SEO Week talk, which is all about authentic intelligence. Can you speak to what you\u2019ll be presenting and kind of like why people should check out what you\u2019re laying down? Wil:  Sure. So, it\u2019s so funny. I\u2019ve been watching my old MozCon presentations and I\u2019m basically like, \u201cdamn, I said this same stuff in 2013, 14, 15\u201d because the RCS presentation dropped in 2012. We\u2019re 13 years later. And I was like, oh, two years after that, I got on stage and said, I watch people go through the SERP and I ask them questions about why are you clicking on what you\u2019re clicking on? So, for 13, uh, for 11 years, I\u2019ve been doing that kind of research, which means I\u2019m starting to understand people and humans and what makes people trust sites, not trust sites. Whereas we\u2019re looking at domain authority and never heard a person\u2013 like most SEOs have never watched a freaking person go through the process of trying to find an answer and talk back on the quality of the answers they got. So therefore, what do you do? You optimize for search. When you hear how people think about things you go, oh my God. So those little seeds have been planted for years and now we just get a chance to deploy what I\u2019ve been trying to do and trying to bring in for years. And you\u2019re like, this is how people are going to start to think about these things. So, for me, man, like that\u2019s like the biggest thing is it\u2019s like, man, it\u2019s a great time to be into human psychology. How do people find their answers to their problems? What makes people trust certain answers more than others? Before, we could get you a number one ranking without doing none of that. Now I think it\u2019s going to potentially reward some of that kind of work more than it has been rewarded in the last 10 years or so. Garrett : I love it, the technology is, is catching up and changing search behavior and it\u2019s getting harder to monitor. Like it really is. But at the same time, it\u2019s that much more important. So, what the hell do people do? Like what do you do right now? Wil:  All right. So to me, Ooh, this is hard because I think so many of us want to know, what do I do right now? And I\u2019m like, \u201cchange your worldview.\u201d And it\u2019s like, Ooh, that\u2019s not an easy answer. Like your worldview should have been, \u201cI help people to find answers.\u201d Too many of our worldview was like, \u201chere\u2019s how to build a thousand pages at scale that sound like they were like kind of almost kind of written by a human.\u201d And I put it through now. Now. So, like for right now we\u2019re building and we\u2019re optimizing pages on our site to perform better in LLMs. The thing that I\u2019m doing right now is interviewing my team members that worked on those projects and pulling out snippets of stories that when somebody who actually has to pick a freaking agency clicks on our page at an industry level, they\u2019re like, \u201cOh, you\u2019re about that life because you would not have a story like that unless you were actually sleeves rolled up in  my  industry.\u201d Most people are like, \u201cyo, how can I get the semantic relevance to show that I look like blah, blah, blah.\u201d And I\u2019m like, \u201cI\u2019m not trying to be semantically relevant. I\u2019m trying to be relevant for humans.\u201d And I think the other thing that we\u2019re seeing is everybody\u2019s so hyped about AI right now. I\u2019m like, I\u2019m hyped about the authentic intelligence AI, because I think at the end of the day, search is, search is cluttered with crap. AI ain\u2019t that much better because it\u2019s going to give you the average answer. How many of us wake up to get the average agency? How many of us wake up to be average people? How many of us want to get the average of whatever? Most of us don\u2019t want to be there. So, I don\u2019t care how much you prompt it. At the end of the day, I would rather have an answer from Garrett Sussman than ChatGPT on a lot on topics that you\u2019re in, that you have expertise on. Right. So, it\u2019s like, well, I\u2019m going to be showing how like I\u2019m growing the business by actually finding out where are humans saying, read this shit from Seer and saying, I\u2019m okay losing the search traffic because I don\u2019t know what those people are coming here for. If you are getting a link from SEO FOMO, if you\u2019re getting a link from Search Engine Land, if you\u2019re getting a link from Microsoft Teams, how many B2B SEOs right now are not tracking which you, which URLs are getting traffic from Microsoft Teams and Slack because those are humans somewhere in an enterprise sharing your shit. That is so much more valuable than something that I got 10 clicks on this, but I don\u2019t know who those people were. Give me 10 enterprise people going to one of my pages over a thousand people going to how to fix a, how to find your site map, your XML site map. Like now I\u2019m done with that. Garrett : I love it. I love it. And it speaks to what Rand\u2019s doing with, with audience research and understanding where your people are spending time. You\u2019re all about it. So like, kind of leads to what, what\u2019s next. We were talking right before this about, you know, personalization and just such a better search experience with like ChatGPT, for instance, what do you think the next few years will look like for buy me an answers? Wil:  So I will say it through the lens of what I\u2019m trying to build for my own business. Cause that\u2019s how you know, it\u2019s fucking real and authentic. Garrett : Bring it. Wil:  I\u2019m hoping, because I don\u2019t really run the business, so I\u2019m hoping to convince Crystal to allow me to build an organic social practice at Seer. That\u2019s where I think this is going because I think people want answers from freaking people yo and AI is only going to make it sound more like \u2013 you know me, now all of a sudden back in the day, you had to do real research on me to write me a good email. Now you can be like, I\u2019m writing an email to Wil, how should I personalize it? So now everybody\u2019s going to sound like they know you, right? What if I actually am a person that you\u2019ve seen over years? Like people will say things about me when they hit me up. Like I\u2019ve been following Wil I\u2019ve been following you for X long. I\u2019ve been watching your posts over years. I authentically feel like you\u2019re that guy on this thing. That\u2019s why I\u2019m referring this person to you. That\u2019s why I\u2019m doubling down on authentic intelligence because it\u2019s the optimal end state. Garrett : Is that for everyone? Is that, are you talking, cause in SEO and search, we always talk about like generalizations. Do you think that works in the context of the small business owner, mom and pop all the way to the big enterprise with like celebrity endorsements? How do you think across different industries and business sizes? Wil:  I think humans, I read a lot about, I read a lot more about humans and psychology than I do about SEO and shit like that. I think humans want to connect with other humans. And if somebody wants to fight me on that, bring it. Good luck with your AI girlfriend. Good luck with your character AI girlfriend. You only have a girlfriend on character AI cause you weren\u2019t able to get a real one in real life. You haven\u2019t learned the life skills to like deal with the push and pull of trying to make a human happy and want them to spend time with you. So now you\u2019re just going to outsource that to AI so that you can just say whatever you want to somebody and they can just answer you. And come on dog. Right. So, to me, it\u2019s like, we got to get back to this human component, which is where the authenticity of your intelligence will ring through. So, for me, I think like, who would you\u2013 last MozCon, I was on stage showing how I bought a Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles video game, a pinball game for my kids. Right. And I showed a video of the guys who I bought it from. They dressed up like Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles to do the unboxing and to talk about all the flaps and the flippers and how all that shit worked. I\u2019m buying from those motherfuckers because you could tell they love the process of opening up a pinball machine and delivering it to a family. They loved it as humans. Now could I have bought that from somebody who optimized a website to show up for Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles pinball game? Yes. But once I click on all 10 of them, who are you going to buy from if the pricing is almost all the same? I\u2019m going to buy my pinball game from the guys that when I emailed this guy, because one of my left flipper just broke a couple of days ago, I emailed the owner of that business at 10pm at night. He got back to me at 10:15. You know why? Because he loves what pinball does for families. That\u2019s different than a guy who\u2019s like, I run this pinball company, so I can make a lot of money and I can make a fat margin and sell it someday. Like, that authenticity will eventually show itself. Right. So that\u2019s why I\u2019m doubling down on that\u2019s a pinball machine. That\u2019s a local freaking company that sold me a pinball machine. So, I feel like this is going back to some like Main Street type shit where like people knew you on Main Street and you had a hardware store on Main Street and the person was like, \u201cyo, last time you came in, you were trying to fix that pool or whatever. Yo, I got this new thing for you.\u201d Like like you, you want to buy more from people like that because they feel like they\u2019re invested in you and they care about you and they care about their craft. So, like I think that whether it\u2019s B2B, B2C, big business, small business, honestly, we still like to buy from humans. That\u2019s why when people are like agents someday, this is super like controversial for some people. I\u2019m like, I don\u2019t think an agent is going to pick somebody\u2019s agency. I don\u2019t think a company is going to go, \u201cyou know what? Like, oh, I\u2019m just going to put an RFP and let everybody answer it. And I\u2019m going to have an agent like go through all the answers.\u201d And I could be wrong, and I could lose my whole business because of this. Right. And I\u2019m like, I think there will be enough people in the market who are like, \u201cI want to talk to these people. I want to see how many people, you know, this, how many people are like, yo, can I meet the team I\u2019m going to work on?\u201d But wait, we told you all the answers. We told you all the answers, dog. Like all the answers are in the RFP. We answered all your questions. Why would you want to meet the humans? Because we\u2019re fucking humans. And then now you get to see who are these people that are going to work on my project? Are they smart? Are they compassionate? How do they carry themselves? Like all that matters in a deal. AI, an agent that picks the agency for your SEO project or whatever, ain\u2019t going to do that. \u00a0I don\u2019t think that people are just going to, oh, I\u2019m going to wake up. Like if you are a, I was buying a charger, an international charger, right? This is the most commoditized effing thing. You know, I still spend 10 minutes on Amazon trying to figure out which one I wanted and blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. Like, so for me, I think that this concept of we want to buy from other humans is a, is a bet that I\u2019m going to make small investments in in 2025. And the reason why it\u2019s because it\u2019s the presentation I\u2019m doing, Garrett, my traffic dropped 45% from search, but my business grew 10% and it wasn\u2019t on like I closed one client. We had more leads than we had before, blah, blah, blah. So then you\u2019re like, well, what\u2019s happening? What\u2019s happening? How did you lose all this traffic and grow your business? I thought those two things didn\u2019t match up. And you go, oh, what happened? I went from my lowest point in November, 2023. I had 239 people get to my website from LinkedIn. In February of 2025, I had 5,200 and you know what happens when you went on LinkedIn and not on some bullshit LinkedIn comments, link on my comments to answer me like that\u2019s fake. The problem when people say shit like that is you are faking your actual influence. So, you don\u2019t know if you\u2019re that influential or if you faked it, got a bump, and can\u2019t sustain it. So that\u2019s why I don\u2019t do none of that shit because then I get to see when my shit is shit. \u201cOh damn, I put this post out. I didn\u2019t ask Rand to push it because I want to find out from real humans, whether or not it\u2019s good or not. So, then I can go back to the lab and try to make it better. If I ask Rand and Mike to push a post that I wrote, it\u2019s going to artificially inflate the value of that fricking post, which then means I can\u2019t decipher whether or not it was really that fucking good.\u201d So for me, it\u2019s like, I\u2019m going to be breaking down in my presentation. A lot of the little things I did along the way that made me be like, \u201coh my God, authentic intelligence for my own business where I can share all the tactics, all the numbers\u201d is how I ended up making those connections. So I know it\u2019s a long winded answer, but it\u2019s a tough question to answer short. We\u2019re talking about the future of fricking search. We\u2019re talking about a 20-year industry, 25-year industry being disrupted and we\u2019re trying to figure out what that looks like. It\u2019s hard to put that into like a, you know, a two second answer. Sorry. Garrett : I know it\u2019s like, it\u2019s like you said, worldview. And I keep thinking, I think I keep thinking about brand and people buy from people and this idea that you do this for a long enough time that every time you put something out and they\u2019re like, oh, Wil dropped another thing. That\u2019s so interesting. The next time they are ready to do an agency, they\u2019re not, people don\u2019t even want to have to like look to 50 million options. They want to find the one they know and, and heuristics, it\u2019s psychology. It\u2019s like, not that we\u2019re lazy, but we want it. We want to just not make a mistake and pick something we trust out of the gate. And that\u2019s going to be Wil. Wil:  Referrals, dog. Like, I don\u2019t know about most people. My business is different, but my whole business has grown. All I know, cause I\u2019m not good at selling. I don\u2019t like selling people on stuff and trying to get you to buy my stuff. I like being who I am and then letting you choose whether or not that connects. Well, if you look at referrals, referrals, why do we want referrals? Because we\u2019re humans. We want a person that we trust to say, I\u2019ve worked with those people. You should talk to them. That lead on paper could be the exact same as somebody who searched \u201cSEO agency\u201d and then hit your lead form and said, \u201cI have a hundred thousand dollar budget.\u201d Trust me, dog. The value of those two leads are entirely freaking different. Garrett : There you go. I mean, you\u2019re going to get, you see Wil talk at SEO Week. It\u2019s going to be freaking huge. Thank you so much, man. It\u2019s just awesome to talk and you know, just kind of get your perspective. Cause you\u2019re always like five steps ahead and you always keep it real, and you always are about like what\u2019s important, which is family, people, life. It\u2019s messy. Thanks again. I appreciate it. Wil:  Thanks for having me. Garrett:  Thanks. Have a good one guys. \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t \n \n\t \n\t\t\t \n \n \n\t \n \n\t \t\t \n\t \t\t\t \n\t\t\tRelated Posts\t\t\t \n\t\t\t

If you haven\u2019t already got your ticket, we are going to be in New York City. April 28th through May 2nd is going to be a week of the most unbelievable speakers in the world. We are fully international this year, talking everything from SEO, AI, content, digital marketing and data science. I am so excited to be here with you, which I\u2019m joined today by Elias Dabbas, who is the creator of advertools. And we are going to talk all about data. What is up, Elias? How are you doing, man? Elias:  Yes, how are you? Great to meet you and hello everyone else watching us. Very excited to be part of this conference and looking forward to meeting everyone. I\u2019m doing great. How are you doing? Garrett : I\u2019m fantastic. I, I, we have, you know, kind of had this like internet chatting back and forth for a while. We finally get to meet in person. I can\u2019t wait to pick your brain. Like even before we started doing this, we were already just going back and forth. So let me dive in. Dude, what is your perspective on the current state of SEO? Like big picture, how are you looking at things? Elias:  Great. So I\u2019ll, I\u2019ll tackle this from the, the angle that I work on most. Like I\u2019m not doing SEO per se as I used to long ago. I\u2019m focusing on the data part. And what I see is that in the last 10, 15 years, like we\u2019re always dealing with data, you know, whether it\u2019s search console, Google analytics, crawl data, log files, you name it, the next keyword tool and all these things. And what has been happening all the time is that we\u2019re getting more sources of data that we have to work with. And the sources have more columns and it\u2019s more amounts of data, like in terms of megabytes or rows. So it\u2019s, it\u2019s becoming overwhelming and it\u2019s, it\u2019s difficult to really tease out some, like just basic questions, like \u201cwhat happened\u201d are becoming quite overwhelming when you, when you consider like you\u2019re, you\u2019re working with like seven, eight data sources and not to mention your own in-house stuff, whether it\u2019s CRM sales and so on. In addition to all the standard digital marketing sources. But at the same time, there\u2019s something really great and exciting that\u2019s happening in the last 10, 15 years. I think it\u2019s as a result of all the developments happening in hardware and software that this field of data science has developed. And the great news is that it\u2019s, you know, all this, these empowerments in hardware and software mean like, mean that people who have zero programming background can start doing some writing some code and getting really productive. And the great news is that you don\u2019t need to become a software developer. This is something that I talk about all the time. A bit of programming, a bit of statistics and math and your domain knowledge, which is in our case, SEO can go a long way in, in, in gaining insights that you didn\u2019t know you can, you can, you can gain, answering questions you didn\u2019t know you can, you can even ask and getting really productive in, in, in interesting ways, like automating your workflows, visualizing data and, and so on. Did I talk too much? Garrett : No, it\u2019s good. Because to your point, it\u2019s, it\u2019s overwhelming, but there\u2019s so much opportunity if you haven\u2019t spent years and years and years learning data science, but there\u2019s still a big education factor. There\u2019s still a ton of value, which kind of leads right into your topic for SEO. Can you kind of give some insights into what people will learn? Like why should they come see you and learn about the value of the data scientist? Elias:  Sure. So, what I\u2019m going to try to show is the sweet spot that is available for us as, as digital marketing people. I\u2019m not going to say that this is better than other ideas or this is right or wrong. I\u2019m just going to say, this is the sweet spot with minimal knowledge, minimum viable knowledge, if you want, with a bit of programming, a bit of, and lots of data education, like visualization, machine learning, statistics, and all these things, they get left out with, with people focusing on Python only. So, the sweet spot is you with a Jupyter notebook, a few main data science libraries. I\u2019ve created one of them. Hopefully this, this helps and I\u2019ll show some, some value in it, hopefully. And by the end of the, of the talk, I\u2019m going to show a few minutes of how you can really get started from scratch. I actually have a video, which is, which is literally eight minutes where you install Python, install two, three packages and actually crawl a website from, from, from scratch. So, I hope this, this gets people excited about getting started with, with this field and then show how, how similar this is actually to Excel functions. If you know how to run an Excel function, which is you put the name of the function, you open parentheses and you put a bunch of parameters. This is how we do it in, in, in, in data science with, with in a Jupyter notebook and with all the functions that we have. You don\u2019t need to create these functions. Other people have done so. There\u2019s a function for crawling websites, the function for analyzing log files. There\u2019s function for XML sitemaps for visualization, you know, just pick and choose what you want. And hopefully it shows that it\u2019s, it\u2019s, it\u2019s interesting and fun. I\u2019m not going to say that it\u2019s, Oh, easy. Anyone can do this in two days. It\u2019s not, but you know, just like anything else worth learning, it\u2019s, it\u2019s worth learning well. Another important thing is that people\u2019s SEO knowledge can go a very long way in, in, in getting those insights and doing much better data science because you understand what\u2019s, what\u2019s going on. And you know, when you look at status codes, for example, these are not just random numbers, you know, you\u2019re not going to someone who doesn\u2019t know what status codes are might come and get, \u201cOh, my average status code is 322.3.\u201d Doesn\u2019t make sense. But because you know SEO and you know these are not quantities, you know what makes sense. You can look at certain numbers and say, this feels a little off because you know, this measurement is typically not that big or not that small and so on. And when I started, I found out that this, my domain knowledge was really, really helpful in, in creating some really useful stuff. From a, from a programming perspective, you\u2019d look at them and they\u2019d be like really simple things. But you know, I used to spend weeks generating keywords for PPC campaigns. Go to the keyword tool. \u201cYes. Oh, no, no, no. Wait a minute. Did I miss that? That\u2019s my 7,562nd keyword. Oh, that should have been a no. Oops, there goes $5,000!\u201d So, creating such tools for these things can be much better done if you know the use case then because we\u2019re not doing software engineering here. We\u2019re not, you know, building tools for Google or Amazon. We are just getting productive in our own work with our own laptop. And that\u2019s, that\u2019s a beginning. Like if people get started and want to expand and specialize in machine learning, they can do so. Some people like myself, I wanted to build some tools. You know, it\u2019s, it\u2019s up to people to do whatever they want. So, I hope that makes sense. Garrett : Yeah, it\u2019s so exciting. And I love what you\u2019re doing empowers people because it\u2019s like, to your point, all these open source libraries that should be used for SEO, where if you are an SEO, but you\u2019re not a full developer, it really empowers you to do a lot of things, to customize things and answer those questions that you might have like felt helpless to or felt dependent on an engineer every time where it\u2019s like, okay, if you do invest a little bit of time, like you said, it\u2019s not always just out of the box, but you\u2019ve invested a little time, and you can apply that to your work and be better at what you do in your little slice of the internet. So, can you give us like, what\u2019s one specific tactical takeaway for listeners that they can do right now? Elias:  So, I think we can, we can, we can share the link to that video where, you know, we can go from scratch to installing Python and crawling a website within eight minutes. And I show the full process. Like it\u2019s not, I know many of those videos that we all see online, that someone does something in three minutes, and then you try to like, \u201cIt doesn\u2019t work!\u201d I get to be that guy this time, but hopefully it works for you. Garrett : That\u2019s awesome. So yeah, you\u2019ll be able to check that out and give it a try and start play with it either to prep for Elias\u2019s talk or to do it, which, you know, people will be able to find you online as well, because you\u2019re, you\u2019re all over the place. I am curious though, one, like the whole theme of this SEO Week is The Next Chapter of Search. So many things have happened over the last 12 months, last 24 months. So almost in the context of big data, what\u2019s your perspective? Where do you see everything going? Elias:  Sure. So, I think we\u2019re going to have more of what I talked about in the beginning, which is more data sources, more data quantities. There\u2019s that detail that\u2019s called generative AI that you might\u2019ve noticed or heard of. That\u2019s going to also be obviously very big. And again, I\u2019m going to show that data science skills are going to be very helpful with, with LLMs prompting them. So, the concept of prompt engineering is more like known as communication skills, plus keep trying a thousand times until something works. I\u2019d like to propose that prompt engineering is more about creating a prompt template that you can use and reuse for thousands of pages, let\u2019s say, you know, so yes, it\u2019s great to take an article and use an LLM to get whatever you want from it, like, you know, extract entities, find the main keywords, the topics, whatever you want, summarize it, rephrase it and so on. But I think it would be great if we can do this in bulk and you need very basic programming skills to be able to do that. A four loop where you have, you know, \u201cplease do X, Y, Z to the following article\u201d where it is well-defined and you can get like 500 classifications of those 500 results in 20 minutes. And that can give a very quick, you know, insight, a bunch of insights that you can get started with, you know, because otherwise if you want to read 500 articles and get the entities and evaluate the titles and it\u2019s going to take a lot of time. And sometimes you\u2019re going to be like, \u201cwell, it\u2019s too costly to do this.\u201d But if I get, if I have a prompt template that I can use to extract all these insights about those hundreds or maybe thousands of URLs, why not do it, you know, it\u2019s going to take a couple of hours. I created an app a few months ago and I released an update a few days ago, which is using the same concept. It\u2019s a prompt template. \u201cPlease answer the following questions about this article and make sure it\u2019s only true and false.\u201d And these are like, you know, 20 things that are taken from Google\u2019s helpful content guidelines. So, the idea is if you get a result that says 80% of your titles are exaggerated and shocking in nature, you know, that\u2019s a very good start to know something about your content, or maybe they\u2019re not that authoritative. Like, you\u2019ve done your homework well, but it\u2019s not the kind of stuff that you would find in a book or an encyclopedia. So, you know, that kind of work that, you know, leveraging LLMs in bulk is something that I think is going to be important, that\u2019s going to differentiate people, especially if you have very basic programming skills. And once you have that, you know, minimum viable knowledge, you can prompt the LLM to say, you know, write the code to do this, or, you know, help me debug this code for that. And it can, you can get really productive really, really fast with LLMs without software engineering and building, you know, that\u2019s\u2026 Garrett : That\u2019s the key. I\u2019m with you. I mean, because that\u2019s the critical upskill right now. Like yes, you can delve deep, you can get into machine learning and really know, you know, kind of explore this whole discipline. But to get that MVP, the minimum or the minimum viable, the MVK, it really is going to be important to basically, I hate to use the term supercharge or superpower, but like leverage the potential of an LLM in a responsible way with data using its capabilities, and then you provide the insights, the analysis at scale. People can do that. Elias, this is cool. I am super excited to hear your talk. Thank you so much for joining me today. I appreciate it, man. Elias:  Thank you very much.

End of April, April 28th to May 2nd, we\u2019re going to be in New York City joined by 35+ of the most influential smart people in the world of SEO, business, AI, marketing, you name it. SEO is the focus, the Next Chapter of Search. I\u2019m joined today by Nick Eubanks. Nick is the VP of owned media at SEMrush. We are going to have a fascinating conversation. He\u2019s doing a lot of interesting things behind the scenes. But first off, Nick, thanks for joining me. How you doing, man? Nick : It\u2019s great to be here, Garrett. It\u2019s always good to see your face and like we were just talking about a moment ago. It\u2019s been a while, so it\u2019s very cool to catch up. Garrett : Dude, it has been a minute from the traffic think tank days to when you came on the Agency Ahead podcast. But I am psyched to talk about where the hell are we right now when it comes to the current state of SEO. How are you looking at things? Nick : I mean, it feels very much like I\u2019m the dog sitting in the house on fire, you know, just saying \u201cit\u2019s fine!\u201d The fact of the matter is it\u2019s not fine in that like there\u2019s just a lot of it\u2019s known unknowns, right? I think that there is a general awareness that like we\u2019re not really sure what this all means because of how fast it\u2019s changing. Is search dead? Is it going to die overnight? Are people going to stop going to Google by the end of this year? Of course not. Absolutely not. But I think the way that people use Google is changing very, very much. You know, I think the if anything, like my hunch is sort of the middle of the funnel is moving away from Google, you know, where you used to be able to build a full funnel strategy and you could have Google as sort of the hub. And I guess you\u2019d have other social components and own media components like an email list, something we really actually own the contact information, you own the audience. And maybe there would be a YouTube component and paid media and it\u2019s sort of all fit around. But you\u2019d have search that you could support each stage of the funnel with a search function. I think we\u2019re seeing that disappear. Well, I sort of evaporate like really, really quickly where I think what I\u2019m seeing at least and what some data that I\u2019ve been privy to is showing like we\u2019re still seeing folks start certain user journeys on Google, although more and more of those sort of top of funnel questions are being funneled into LLMs and into AI tools. And then we\u2019re still very much seeing the bottom of the funnel show up on Google. I don\u2019t think the recommendation engine that is being served by LLMs is so good yet that folks are getting what they want and they\u2019re getting their queries satisfied. That will probably change at some point, but it\u2019s not going to be this year. And so I think the question on everybody\u2019s minds right now is how big of a share of searches, of queries and then of the clicks that come out of those queries is going to go to these to GPTs and LLMs and what does that mean for us as folks who identify as SEOs or recovering SEOs? Garrett : Exactly. And that\u2019s the thing that\u2019s so interesting to me is how search behavior is potentially changing. Is it changing? But you, like your current role is almost this like bird in the sky look to the point of this changing ecosystem as purchasing all of these assets that are part of SEMrush. You guys have been in the news over the past year. In terms of like what you\u2019re presenting at SEO Week and what people can really find for you, whether it\u2019s like conversations or your actual presentation, what are you thinking about in terms of the business aspect of owned media, of an enterprise level brand and owning these different properties in the context of SEO? Nick : I think more than anything and what I will probably will talk about, you know, if you guys let me, is the true concept of owned media and how you start thinking from a brand perspective of what owned media needs, right? Of having ownership over your audience, how you can insulate yourself from major sort of, you know, major shifts in the search landscape, right? So like one of the things that I\u2019m really focused on right now, what we\u2019re trying to do with the portfolio that we\u2019re building is to, you know, find traffic sources that are organic, but aren\u2019t necessarily driven from search. So you know, you buy something like Backlinko or Exploding Topics or Third Door Media that all have, you know, multi-hundred thousand email lists or, you know, Backlinko\u2019s got a bustling YouTube presence and YouTube channel. You know, where are there other opportunities like Third Door Media where like, you know, a big part of the traffic profile is direct, you know, people bookmark them, people have that as their homepage on their browser. And they have, you know, because they\u2019ve been around so long and it\u2019s a news source, it\u2019s a trusted, you know, brand and news source. And it comes with an event that, you know, we\u2019re resurrecting this year in June, like we\u2019re going to bring SMX back for the first time in five years, you know, that\u2019s something that went fully virtual and that Third Door Media never had any intention of bringing back into real life again, because it was way more profitable to run it virtually. But, you know, we\u2019re not looking at this from a how do we profit from this event? It\u2019s how do we resurrect this brand? How do we, you know, breathe new life back into these brand assets as brand assets that, you know, can hopefully capture and expand on mindshare and build trust within the entirety of our audience segment. So, I think more than anything, you know, the lens to look at this through the one that I\u2019m trying to look at this through is what does it mean in a land where search directly becomes less important? And what can we do to protect ourselves from that shift? Garrett : I love it. And it\u2019s really interesting. And so if you were to speak to someone who\u2019s in a position similar to yours at a Fortune 500, where they can focus on purchasing these owned assets and building their audience, what\u2019s a practical recommendation in the way that you think about that strategy that they can start implementing like right now? Nick : I think it\u2019s got to be understanding the audience affinity, right? And the way that we are still approaching that in the way that I think almost anybody that has a significant search footprint, you know, we still we still rack up tens of millions of visits every month just to SEMrush. And then when you look at the whole ecosystem, it\u2019s a big number. And so we\u2019re still able to look at the audience that we are acquiring from search and the keywords and the topics that we\u2019re acquiring them for, you know, where is the overlap there? Who else has mindshare or click share for those same topics? And using that as sort of a leading indicator to go identify, you know, where we want to go or, you know, if we\u2019re going to buy email lists, it\u2019s what\u2019s the percentage of overlap from the subscribers for this asset we want to buy versus this subscriber list for SEMrush or Backlinko or Third Door Media? You know, is there is there a percentage overlap that that\u2019s significant enough that we\u2019re like, hey, these folks are already within our audience segment. They\u2019re already within our user or customer segment, which means that the affinity of the other people just like thinking in terms of like lookalike audiences probably is pretty high. There\u2019s a good chance that we can probably sell into those audiences some product or service or build a brand affinity for something within our ecosystem and then beginning to understand how that affinity changes based on the different assets, right? Like the affinity of the audience for exploding topics. There\u2019s a lot of overlap with the SEMrush audience, but there\u2019s also still a whole bunch of people that aren\u2019t in the SEMrush audience that give us an opportunity to expand. And so I think starting to look at it through that lens becomes really powerful when you think about identifying acquisition opportunities, partnership opportunities. Garrett : Yeah, and I think that that\u2019s like as SEOs, what you\u2019re doing is like boots on the ground real marketing, like that is marketing. It\u2019s all about understanding complementary markets and making sure that you\u2019re building that awareness, that visibility and that market share through the acquisitions in the context of SEO. So what direction do you think we\u2019re all going in? You and I were briefly talking about it, but where do you think search is going over the next period? Nick : I mean, I think there\u2019s going to be a big chunk of it that kind of goes away. Like I think there\u2019s going to be, you know, the funnel is not, it already doesn\u2019t look the way it did 12 months ago. I think parts of it are going to sustain in the search ecosystem in Google for the most part or other search engines that are gaining market share very quickly that are built on the backs of LLMs. But I think we\u2019re going to see compartmentalization that we\u2019re already seeing. So like it\u2019s, I think the big question on everybody\u2019s, every modern marketer\u2019s mind is \u201chow much degradation are we going to see and which parts of the funnel are going to evaporate the fastest?\u201d Garrett : That\u2019s fascinating. It\u2019ll be really interesting to pay attention to this. And anyone who says that they know what\u2019s going to happen really doesn\u2019t. If you had to guess what\u2019s your confidence level that Google\u2019s market share will be, you know, kind of cut into, or do you think they\u2019ll just maintain their dominance? Nick : I think they are scrambling right now with Gemini and, you know, people are using it. You know, I talked to a lot of people that have it, you know, as part of their, their stack, the folks that are doing the most with, with, with AI right now are, are, you know, chaining prompts and using different Raptors and, and, and building their own GPTs and trying to combine as many components from as many LLMs as they can to, to figure out how, how this all can fit together to create efficiencies or just to be where, where people are going. But, you know, we\u2019re already seeing a departure and I shouldn\u2019t say a shift in just the behavior. And so, you know, the, the billion-dollar question that everybody\u2019s trying to answer right now is how do we make sure that our brands, whatever those are, are the ones that are being raised and recommended and linked to from inside these LLMs. And that\u2019s, that\u2019s the big question, right? And I think there\u2019s, there\u2019s a bunch of great ideas and there\u2019s a lot of people doing a lot of experimentation. I know you guys are doing, you know, I know, I know iPR is very much doing their own experiments, but I think that\u2019s going to be the most fascinating data to come out. You know, hopefully this year we\u2019ll get some insight into, you know, what it really means, how to, how to attack these things to make sure that you\u2019re following the wave as it moves. Garrett : 100%. Final question. Has your, has your search behavior changed at all? Nick : A little bit. Yeah, a little bit. Places, like things that I would probably usually go to YouTube for, or I\u2019d go to Google and expect to end up on YouTube, you know, those things are getting dropped more and more frequently into ChatGPT and, and Claude and, you know, a little Perplexity here and there. I\u2019m having a lot more fun playing with a lot of the content tools out there and sort of experimenting with like, one of the things that\u2019s probably the most fascinating to me was, you know, eight months ago, I was all about writing these like huge prompts, 2,500 to 3,000 word prompts, huge prompts, you know, where it would take multiple hours to get the output of them from a content perspective. And now, you know, instead of being able to upload just scores of documents, so like building custom GPTs that are brand or function specific and just giving it all the information for ingestion and then the prompts are a sentence or two, you know, it\u2019s, it\u2019s, you know, less is more is such a big way and letting, letting, letting the, the AI sort of do the work now is, is, you know, very impressive. Garrett : That\u2019s so cool. Well, thank you so much. This has been a really interesting conversation. For those of you who are watching, please, please, please, if you haven\u2019t gotten your ticket April 28 to May 2nd in New York City, join us for SEO Week.

If you haven\u2019t already got your tickets, I\u2019m talking April 28th to May 1st in New York City. It is going to be the best SEO conference in the history of the universe, probably. And you know why? Because Brie Anderson\u2019s going to be there. Brie is the owner at Beast Analytics. She\u2019s being joined by 35+ amazing speakers across AI, SEO, data, content, you name it. Brie, what\u2019s up? Thanks for joining me today. Brie:  I\u2019m stoked and I gotta say this lineup, legendary. I mean, easily the most stacked lineup ever. So, I\u2019m stoked. Garrett : Dude, I can\u2019t wait for all the conversations that we\u2019re going to have after every single presentation, let alone being able to learn so much info in such a short amount of time. But let\u2019s dive in. The world is nuts. The search world has been crazy for the past 12 to 24 months and beyond. What\u2019s your perspective on the current state of SEO and search? Brie:  I cannot believe how fast, constantly changing. I mean, listen, I think, you know, two, three, four, five years ago, you asked any search marketer, like, you know, \u201cwhat brings you to search? Like, what do you love about it?\u201d And everyone would be like, \u201coh, it just changes all the time,\u201d you know? And we love that \u2019cause so many of us love to like, to learn new things and be constantly challenged and whatever. But I think Google took that a little too seriously. And so did just like the technology world in general. And they went, you want to challenge? And it has been nuts. So, you know, my background, I did like, I did social stuff that turned into paid social, that turned into paid Google, that just turned into SEO. And so, and now I\u2019m like, the one thing that connects all of that is data, and that\u2019s great, so I\u2019m focused on the data more. So, I\u2019ve taken a little bit of a step back from SEO specifically. And anytime somebody comes to me from the SEO world, I\u2019m just like, \u201chow are you doing? Like, are you okay?\u201d Because even on my end, trying to keep up with, you know, what should we be tracking? What, you know, is even worth tracking? Because what do we control at this point? I think one of the biggest changes is the control that we have now is nearly non-existent. So, there\u2019s only so much we can do, you know? Or at least that\u2019s what it feels like from my point of view. Garrett : No, I love the perspective. And it is, it\u2019s so hard. And analytics is so hard because you have this like push and pull of like, are we losing third party, you know, third party cookies? Like, are things changing across Google? They are, they aren\u2019t. Attribution is always this conversation because we always have this mindset of performance marketing. And then everything all of a sudden is brand. And that\u2019s just not the way SEO is anymore. And so, you are going to be presenting all about, you know, what you should be doing when it comes to analytics in 2025. Can you give us a preview of what people will be learning from your talk at SEO Week and like, why should they come? It\u2019s going to be juicy, but give it to me. Brie:  Yeah, so I think the biggest thing is like, we need to have, I mean, we need to go back to tracking 101 and go, what is our plan here? What are we tracking and why? What are we going to do with it? Because that, like, it seems in the moment, like an obvious, right? But like, we really have to take a step back and especially in the times that we\u2019re living where everyone\u2019s job is constantly on the line, which I feel like I\u2019ve been saying that for five years, which is just a terrible thing to think about. But what are, you know, we have to report out to clients or we have to report out to CEOs. Like, we know that there are certain metrics they want to see. And those are the things that we need to make sure are being tracked. But then also we need to make sure that we\u2019re looking at, you know, these new launches that we\u2019re doing, campaigns that we\u2019re doing, are we tracking those and the efficacy of those? And then also changing into, how are we making these numbers accessible? How are we making them easy to read? And then how are we leveraging that data? To be honest, I mean, if you think back to the scientific method, which is like basically what I preach, the one thing that\u2019s really hard about it right now is that change piece, right? We don\u2019t have a ton of constants or control variables. So we need to make as many of those as we can. We need to be aware of what are not controlled variables. And then we need to create a plan for how are we going to track this? And then how are we going to look at the data? How are we going to make the data so easy to look at that anyone on our team can look at it? Big hint here, these are things that we learned in elementary school, patterns, and then outliers. One of these things just doesn\u2019t belong here. I mean, that\u2019s a Sesame Street song. And we can spot those. We can create ways that finding these patterns and these outliers are easy. It\u2019s just a matter of making sure you\u2019re tracking the right things and then putting them into formats that are easy to digest. Garrett : I love it. And I love the way that you frame it. I mean, it\u2019s like you live it and breathe it, but it\u2019s so true when it comes to scientific method. And it is so overwhelming. We have a chaotic world where things are changing constantly. And it\u2019s really hard to ever feel like you do have a grasp on whether you\u2019re thinking for the future or whether you\u2019re thinking what worked on the past because data, you know, like it\u2019s, I think about like going back to the pandemic, it\u2019s like all the data we collected then is not always applicable to going forward because it\u2019s a completely different market, a completely different user behavior. What is one thing that this audience can do right now from your perspective, from analytics that they should get on their butt and do that would really move the needle for their business? Brie:  I mean, I think the biggest thing that, you know, was kind of kicked into gear with the shift to GA4, but kind of not is to just like, let\u2019s review and document our tracking, okay? Let\u2019s start there. Because you might think you know what you\u2019re tracking and it might not be what you think it is at all. Analytics properties are things that are handed from team to team, agency to agency, person to person, no dev controls it, no IT controls it, no marketing, no growth, no. So, let\u2019s all just take a step back, get our analytics properties, take everything out of it, compare it to our tag managers, whatever you\u2019re using, and then let\u2019s document it. And say, hey, we thought donate event happened when people were making donations, it turns out it\u2019s just when people click on the donate button. Well, those are two very different things. So, you know, I think really, really, really truly, we\u2019ve got to get back to basics a little bit and all of that starts with making sure you know what you\u2019ve got going on. And again, it\u2019s one of those like, oh, that sounds like an easy thing and it sounds like something that everybody should have. It\u2019s not, I\u2019ll tell you. All of my clients come to me because they actually don\u2019t know what\u2019s going on in their accounts. And I\u2019ll say it, I\u2019ve got a good number of clients. So, I can\u2019t imagine that they\u2019re outliers in this instance. Garrett : I love it. It\u2019s almost like the don\u2019t be the Chris Pratt meme where it\u2019s like, you know, like, I don\u2019t know what\u2019s going on with my analytics and I\u2019m too afraid to ask. Like, don\u2019t be that person. Brie:  Yeah, \u2019cause we need reliable data. I mean, in the Cambridge Analytica documentary that came out on Netflix, I can\u2019t remember what it\u2019s called, but you know, they\u2019re quoted in that special saying that data is the most valuable asset in the world. And it is, but really only when you use it. Only if it\u2019s good data and only if it\u2019s being used. And so much of what we do right now is we collect all this data going someday, this is going to be helpful. And then we just never get to it. So we\u2019ve got to make it so terribly easy that it would be dumb not to. And that\u2019s what we\u2019re going to do at SEO Week. Garrett : I love it. It\u2019s a don\u2019t be a someday marketer, which kind of leads perfectly into the someday of the future. Like, what direction are we going? Either like in terms of the industry of search, but especially in the context of data, like what do you think that\u2019ll look like? Brie:  You know, things are going to be harder and harder to attribute to specific channels, but I\u2019ll tell you what, for a long time, things really should be attributed to one channel. So, you know, user journeys today are so wild. I mean, unless you\u2019re buying a $5 spatula off of Amazon, so where there\u2019s like no decision-making happening, you\u2019re just like, I need this in two days. And I know that I can get one on Amazon. And all I care about is that it\u2019s cheap and flips pancakes. Like, yeah, but most of us don\u2019t have a product that\u2019s sold that easily. And so, to me, in my opinion, kind of silly to be like, oh, this conversion came from Google. Like we need to have, I think we\u2019re going to have to lean into more of correlation studies, LLM studies, where we\u2019re going to have to be looking at like, okay, we know if we\u2019re running Facebook ads that we also get this secondary lift in like Google searches because people see our ads and then they\u2019re thinking about it later on. And they\u2019re like, \u201coh, well, I saw this.\u201d And like, we\u2019ll see the click come from Google search, but like maybe not Facebook ads. But like, if we didn\u2019t have the ads running, they wouldn\u2019t be looking for us \u2019cause they never, you know what I mean? So, I think we\u2019re going to have to get away from that. It was so nice that we could go click, click, boom, right? That\u2019s not working anymore though, because it\u2019s getting so robust that we\u2019re going to have to be a little bit more out of the box in the way that we\u2019re analyzing data and the way that we\u2019re looking at, yeah, efficacy of our campaigns. In search, especially, I mean, AI overviews. I mean, people talking to Cursor, people talking to ChatGPT. So much of this is turning into brand as a new entity. I know we\u2019re hearing that a ton and ton. And what does that mean? That means that when people are ready to work with us, we\u2019re going to see it as organic search, which, hey, for my SEOs, that\u2019s going to be great. That\u2019s going to be great. But for everybody else that\u2019s working on it or it\u2019s going to look like direct. And by the way, that sucks because then nobody gets the piece of the pie for that. So, I think it\u2019s just going to be a little bit more complex. I think we\u2019re going to have to kind of let go of the idea of like first touch, last touch. We\u2019re going to have to be more comfortable in going, \u201cthese things are probably related,\u201d and testing them \u2013 by the way, do your own tests. And that\u2019s what we\u2019re going to have to do. Garrett : And especially like in the context of what you\u2019re saying about the scientific method and these studies, it\u2019s, you have to be responsible with the way you analyze a correlation study at the same time. Remember, I gotta say it every time it comes up, correlation does not mean causation. Like you need to be, you need to learn how to use data and actually come away with hypotheses that you can test and not just assume that this is happening because of this, because that\u2019s going to point you in a completely wrong direction most of the time. Brie:  So, our Facebook ads been went up, our organic search went up. Great, those things are correlated. Hey, here\u2019s the next test, turn them off. Or organic search then. And also make sure you look at Google Trends \u2019cause they\u2019re just a huge spike and people searching for mattresses that week and you sell mattresses because something happened, I don\u2019t know, you know what I mean? Like, these are the things where it is, like I always build in an exploration step. You can\u2019t just look at those two pieces of data. It\u2019s like, what else could have affected this data? And then if you still think there is a correlation, great, turn them off, see what happens. Garrett : Exactly. Brie:  So, you know, so. Garrett : Check your biases, check your incentives. It\u2019s going to be such a great presentation, and I can\u2019t wait to meet you in person. We\u2019re going to have a fun time. Brie, if you haven\u2019t gotten your tickets, make sure you get them for SEO Week, end of April. Thank you for joining me today, Brie. This has been awesome. Brie:  Thanks for having me. Garrett : Okay, we\u2019ll see you next time, SEOweek.org.

Ruth Burr Reedy with demonstrate how this shift goes beyond forecasting to connect inputs to outcomes and demonstrate consistent progress toward SEO goals, even before that tipping point where the results have started to roll in.

If you have not bought your tickets yet, we\u2019re talking New York City, April 28th to May 1st, 36+ of the most amazing SEOs, data scientists, content creators, you name it. They\u2019re all going to be there speaking, telling us about SEO, AI, data, content, everything. And I am so excited because one of the best people in our industry is joining me today. I\u2019m joined by Ruth Burr Reedy. She is the Senior SEO Manager at Houzz. How are you doing today, Ruth? Ruth : I\u2019m good, how are you? Garrett : I\u2019m doing good. I\u2019m bringing a lot of energy, but that\u2019s only because it\u2019s always so fun to chat with you, talk SEO, talk the world. But let\u2019s dive in. The last 12, 24 months of the search industry has been wild. What\u2019s your take on the current state of SEO? Ruth:  So, I think as we\u2019ve had some really exciting advancements, we\u2019ve had a lot of really great new information that I think is helping us recontextualize some of the things that we do, which is really cool. You know, AI has obviously been, you know, I can\u2019t not talk about AI when you ask me this question. It\u2019s been a huge sort of boulder dropped in the pond of SEO with lots of ripples out in various directions. I think that we all are starting to calm down about AI, which I\u2019m excited about. I\u2019m excited about calming down because I always get a little skeptical when people get really excited about what is basically a tool. And, you know, AI and large language models, generative text tools are all really interesting and can be very valuable. And I think have introduced new and interesting scale and efficiency into a lot of the work that we do. And it is a tool. And, you know, you can buy the nicest hammer in the world and it will not build a house for you. So, I am excited to see people starting to talk more practically about the applications of AI and especially starting to lean more into what AI is and is not good at. Garrett, I think you\u2019ve heard me make this analogy before that AI is the microwave. So, you know, when the microwave came out, everybody was like so excited about the microwave and there are all these cookbooks. Like I think most of us who have boomer parents have seen at least one like microwave cooking cookbook. I don\u2019t know anybody who\u2019s getting those out these days. By this time, like, everybody understands what the microwave is, what it does, what it can do well. And there are things like, yeah, you can roast a turkey in the microwave. Is it going to be as good as roasting it in the oven? Maybe not. Is it going to be as easy as roasting in the oven? Probably not. So I think that it\u2019s the same with AI where like there\u2019s a lot of stuff that AI tools can do that other existing technology can do as well or better that maybe we don\u2019t need to use AI for. There\u2019s other things where AI seems like it does it well but you have to be really careful that you\u2019re getting the results that you think that you have. And so I\u2019m enjoying seeing people kind of settle in and really gain a better practical understanding of where and where this technology should and should not be used so that we can get back to talking about the results that we\u2019re achieving and how we\u2019re actually using technology to connect users with things that we\u2019re trying to market to them, which is what we\u2019re doing. I\u2019m excited to talk more about marketing and less about tools. Garrett : I agree. And it\u2019s fascinating to watch the progression of the last two years and how much, as you get more education, when people don\u2019t understand it, it just looks like magic to them. And then the more you understand, you understand its limitations, the appropriate use cases, and yeah, it\u2019ll get better over time. But to your point, it\u2019s not an easy button or a magic button. It\u2019s just garbage in, garbage out, and so much more nuance to it. And yet it\u2019s very polarizing. Everyone has a very strong opinion one way or the other. Ruth:  Well, and I think right now we are, you know, SEOs. I love SEO so much. I was talking to somebody the other day about how I don\u2019t think I could ever leave this industry because the people are so great. And we do ruin everything we touch as a larger group. And I think we are seeing right now, one of the things that I\u2019m very frustrated about is just the degree of absolute garbage that is on the internet right now because of people who are not being judicious about how they\u2019re using this tool. But I agree, it is very polarizing. You know, I have a lot of qualms about like the environmental impact of AI tools. And I talked to a lot of SEOs about that, and they\u2019re like, \u201cHave you tried Macaron?\u201d And I have, and I can\u2019t. So, you know, yeah, you\u2019re right. Everybody does have really strong opinions and that makes for great conversations, and I love conversations. But I think I\u2019ll be interested in the next 12 to 24 months to see how all of that evolves. Garrett : And speaking of conversations, your presentation is really about like the human aspect of SEO, which is project management, especially when you\u2019re getting these large projects going. I\u2019m really curious for you, like what is the main reason that someone should come and hear you speak about this topic at SEO Week? Ruth : Yeah, so SEO is so inherently consultative, so much of how we are able to be impactful and effective, and this is true whether you work at an agency or in-house, I think especially true when you work in an agency. So much of your ability to be effective is dependent on your ability to convince people to do stuff. So how to convince people to do stuff is something that\u2019s been really top of mind for me in the last couple of years. You are going to assign a keyword to this, which you know I have done. A lot of that falls under the umbrella of organizational change management. So how to affect lasting change within not just your client or your workplace, but within internal teams and other vendors and people to whom you\u2019re being consultative. So this talk is really about something that I have always been really frustrated as an analytics girlie, as a long time data-driven SEO. It\u2019s so hard with SEO because often it takes a long time to see results that when you are reporting on KPIs, it almost feels it\u2019s not exciting because you are already working on something else. By the time the numbers that you report on come in, that is the impact of work that you may have done weeks or months ago. And so there is kind of an ongoing lagging metric. And so what I really encourage people to think about is how to start talking about the impact of what they\u2019re doing earlier and how to start reporting on the impact or the forecast or perspective impact of what they\u2019re doing now. So thinking about leading metrics, if you know that it takes somebody on average of 12 months, this is a made up number, 12 months between the first time they encounter your brand and when they convert, and it\u2019s an average of five touches, okay, then you know that what you\u2019re doing right now, if what you\u2019re doing right now is building top of funnel experiences, is not going to have an impact for 12 months. That doesn\u2019t mean that you don\u2019t get to talk about how great you are for another 12 months. You can talk about the forecasted impact. You can talk about when you are going to start seeing those numbers and you can back that into numbers that you\u2019re reporting on now. So you might not feel like you can say, I added related entities and related keywords and refreshed and reoptimized 50 pieces of content because I don\u2019t want to say no one cares. I care, great job, super excited for you. The CEO doesn\u2019t care. Your point of contact within your client organization may or may not care. They do have numbers that they do care about. And so not just during the sales process, I think you\u2019ve probably experienced this a lot, like you\u2019ve been at a iPullRank for a long time. During the sales process, you do a lot to connect SEO actions to company goals. It\u2019s really important to continue connecting those actions to their ultimate goals throughout the lifetime of a campaign. And you can do that by understanding what the leading metrics that you\u2019re affecting are and what the inputs that you\u2019re optimizing are. So that\u2019s the other thing, is that we tend to report on outputs, even though as SEOs, we are always subject to a third party, which is the search engine or now at this point, it\u2019s the search engine. It might be social media, it might be email, it might be various generative AI tools, but all of that is stuff that we can\u2019t fully control. And this is why I think SEOs love on-page SEO and technical SEO so much, is because it\u2019s entirely within our control and we just have to do it. And when we are only looking at outputs, we are always having to filter our actions through those actions of a third party. When we can start reporting on the inputs, like what we\u2019re doing now, how those are forecast to impact metrics down the road, not only does it make what we\u2019re doing now more meaningful to the rest of the business, who often have no idea what we\u2019re up to. SEO, like we\u2019re basically Chandler to most of the people we know. People don\u2019t really understand what we do at our job. So, we can help them understand what we do and why it\u2019s important. I think a couple of other things that starting to report on your own activities through that lens can do, one is to really highlight the opportunity cost of not doing things. So, in any organization, there\u2019s a finite number of resources, whether you\u2019re an eight person team with one really overworked developer or like a large multinational corporation, there are resources and you\u2019re in competition with other business units and other business needs for those resources. And you don\u2019t always win and that\u2019s normal and appropriate. And being able to say, we were supposed to have done X and in 12 months, that would result in Y. We only did half of X, which means now we\u2019re looking at 14 months until Y. And really continuing to highlight the impact that those inputs are having on future outputs can help you continue to make a case and get ongoing buy-in, not just from the top, which we talk about a lot, but from the people who actually have to do the work, your actual internal customers as a consultant, whether that\u2019s developers, whether that\u2019s paid media, whether that\u2019s financing and accounting, whoever that is that you need to work with in order to get things done. Helping them articulate internally and helping articulate to them internally why you\u2019re doing what you\u2019re doing and what happens if you don\u2019t do it can help you maintain momentum on longer term SEO projects because SEO is a long game. And I would really love to see more people talking about the value of what they\u2019re doing now, not just the value of things that they already did. Garrett : Oh my goodness, there\u2019s so much value to this talk that you\u2019re giving and the way that you articulate it, it resonates because it really is about communication. It\u2019s the mindset, it\u2019s translation, it\u2019s storytelling to the right audience to ultimately, it\u2019s not like a zero sum, like win-lose. It\u2019s like I find ways that everyone can win and also get your projects the momentum, which is the big picture to go across the line. It\u2019s even more relevant. I mean, it\u2019s always relevant, but it\u2019s even more relevant now when we think about different contexts, like what was happening during COVID, what do you do? What happens during a recession, what do you do? What happens with AI, what do you do? Thinking long-term to your point, as the markets and the economy is constantly shifting, as an SEO, you really kind of need to speak that language so that you can, to your point about resource allocation, it ultimately, you get the buy-in. And knowing how to do that, you\u2019re going to give these folks the language to do that effectively. Ruth:  Yeah, yeah, and I think that\u2019s, I think, a great point about what do you do in changing circumstances because things can change on a dime, especially within SEO, and that\u2019s always been true. And sometimes you\u2019ll be partway through a project and something will happen that makes that project less important, less important than something else that you could be doing or less important than something else that the rest of the team could be doing. If your client\u2019s website breaks and is not functioning, that\u2019s more important than updating the blog. No one\u2019s going to see the blog if it\u2019s not live. So being able to articulate the long-term impacts of doing or not doing something now means that you can also spot when you are starting to work on something that is less important than something else and articulate the reasons for that pivot so that your client might be like, \u201cYou sold me this package of A, B, and C thing. I thought that\u2019s what you were going to do.\u201d Being able to say, \u201cYes, I did tell you that, and now I\u2019m looking at these numbers, and here we can still do that,\u201d and \u201chere would be the results. And if you want to pivot to this other project, I think it would be more impactful, and here\u2019s why.\u201d When I was at an agency, that was something that I always built into our agreements is I want the ability to pivot. I want that to be something that is easy for you to say to me as a client. I want that to be something easy for me to say to you as a vendor, \u201cI don\u2019t want to get in there,\u201d this happened once we onboarded a client, and we got in there, and all of their analytics was wrong. And so they were just looking at bad data that did not accurately reflect anything. And I was like, \u201cOkay, I can\u2019t in good conscience do keyword research for you right now. Your website is on fire, and we need to put that out, and then I will do keyword research.\u201d So yeah, I think having an idea of the long-term impacts of various projects and being able to articulate that also helps you spot when you could be being more impactful and articulate the reasons for that change internally. Garrett : Yeah, it makes sense to really showcase your expertise and the consultative nature for a messy world. What is something that someone can do right now? What is your major tactic that someone who\u2019s watching this right now can do that ties into your talk? Ruth:  I think regardless of who you\u2019re working for, if you don\u2019t already have a really strong idea of, we\u2019re in March, it\u2019s a great time to be talking about this. You don\u2019t already have a really strong idea of your company\u2019s goals for, or your client\u2019s goals for Q2 and Q3. You need to understand that. And I don\u2019t just mean like make money, because like, yeah. But what are we growing? By how much? What are the organization-wide tactics that your clients are going to plan to use to get where they need to go? And how is what you\u2019re doing going to roll up to those? I would then take it a step further and look at the leading metrics. So, if your ultimate metric is revenue, a leading metric could be leads. A leading metric could be email signups. It depends on the model of your business. Okay, great, but that\u2019s still an output, not an input. So, from there, look at the projects that you know already you want to do and figure out what the inputs are that are going to affect those outputs and map them. Map your inputs to your outputs and then build that into your report. So, now\u2019s a great time to change your reporting. I know, because you don\u2019t have anything else going on. But once you start building into your reporting, not just that look back, not just, okay, it\u2019s March, we\u2019re going to look at what happened in February, but also here\u2019s what we\u2019re doing in March and here\u2019s what we expect the impact to be in April, May, June. Start building that into your reports. Call people\u2019s attention to the thing that you want them to be paying attention to, which is almost always what you\u2019re doing now, not just what you did before. And once you have that set up for yourself, then you can start iterating on it and improving it the same way you would any other report. Garrett : There you go. Right now, you can start thinking about those appropriate leading metrics. I love it. So, Ruth, bigger picture, what\u2019s next? Like, what do you see happening in our search industry going forward? Ruth:  So, I think that right now on the internet is a fascinating time for facts. And I think that right now it is a fascinating time for expertise. I think if you look at user behaviors online, user trust in the information that they\u2019re finding is at a low. And you see that reflected in search behaviors. You see that in people increasingly going to forums, in people increasingly going to websites and communities and email newsletters and not searching because there is a damaged trust. And I think that has to do with the level of garbage output that SEOs, among other people, are flooding the internet with right now. So, I think in order to succeed in the next couple of years, I think Google has been trying to do this with varying levels of success for a while. That idea of experience and expertise, to me, the value of experience is that it provides a point of view. You\u2019ve done this enough that you have opinions about it. So, I think we are going to have to start, and I\u2019ve been saying this for the record since 2019, we have to start paying more for content. We have to start actually getting people who know what they\u2019re talking about to talk to people about the things that we do. And so, I think one of the fabulous things about generative text tools is that it, for the first time, really provides us a scalable way to get information out of the heads of people who are very smart and very experienced, but who are not writers and who don\u2019t have time to write. And the idea of creating a piece of content for you makes them want to die. Like, okay, you don\u2019t have to create a piece of content for me. Get on a half hour phone call with me that I\u2019m going to record, and then I\u2019m going to use that phone call to make a blog post that you just wrote. Boom. And I am hoping that SEO as an industry will see that opportunity for what it is and not think, okay, now I don\u2019t have to talk to another person at all. I can just get the computer to spit out 500 words about blue teapots, and now I rank number one for blue teapots. If everyone else is doing that, what\u2019s the differentiator? The differentiator comes from somebody who actually knows what TF they\u2019re talking about. So, I think we\u2019re going to have to start paying more for content, seeking out more expertise. And I think the other thing is that the funnel has completely changed. So, Andy Crestodina had a great LinkedIn post a while back talking about optimizing for, it\u2019s no longer just informational, transactional. It is now optimizing for visit website intent. Are you optimizing around the things, creating the things that people might need to go to a website to find, as opposed to getting it from ChatGPT, getting it from an AI overview? You want to be there too, of course, and there are ways to do that, which I\u2019m sure someone else will talk about it at NYC SEO Week. And thinking about where those tools can\u2019t give people what they need, what do you have that\u2019s unique that people might come to you for? And hey, that might actually not be, this is the other thing, and this has been coming for a while, is that SEO is no longer just about your website. SEO is about all of the other places that you can show up online. It\u2019s about social media. It\u2019s about presence in forums. It\u2019s about figuring out where your audience goes if they can\u2019t trust Google to give them what they need. Where do they go? And are you there? And are you showing them that you have what they need? I think it is a really interesting evolution of the kind of tactics that we use and an opportunity for us all to get a lot better at multi-channel strategies, which are my jam. So, I\u2019m excited about it. Garrett : There you go. And it really does come together because that\u2019s the way I think about it too. It\u2019s like SEO is not easy. It\u2019s more holistic. It\u2019s more of a support channel in a lot of ways, but we really as marketers need to step outside of the way that we\u2019re used to doing things and start to open our perspectives on creative new ways to integrate everything because just getting easy traffic that converts is not a thing anymore. Ruth:  I wish it was. That was fun, but it\u2019s over now. Garrett : There you go. Ruth : It was a good time while it lasted. Garrett : So, make sure if you haven\u2019t already, get your tickets for SEO Week. Come chill with Ruth and I. We will be having all sorts of fun conversations. She is going to have this really important dynamic presentation. We will see you in New York City at the end of April. We will catch you later. Thanks again for joining us. See you there. Ruth:  Bye-bye.

Search engines don\u2019t just rank pages anymore\u2014they build complex maps of how brands and concepts connect. Dan Petrovic will show you how to tap into the same technology Google uses to understand brand positioning in a way that traditional SEO tools can\u2019t. Why rankings alone don\u2019t tell the full story of your brand\u2019s visibility How to use language models to uncover hidden brand associations A step-by-step look at the DEJAN methodology for mapping brand perception \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t \n\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t Transcript \t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t \n\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t Garrett : Okay, hey everybody, welcome to The Next Chapter of Search presented by SEO Week and iPullRank. Today I am joined by Dan Petrovich, who is the managing director at Dijon. And I\u2019m going to talk to him a little bit about the world of SEO. Dan, thanks for joining me today. How you doing, man? Dan:  I\u2019m doing very well, thank you. Garrett : Okay, let\u2019s dive right in. State of SEO, there\u2019s a lot in flux over the last few years. Can you share your perspective on the current state of SEO? Where are we at? Dan:  Well, currently we\u2019re looking at a very activated Google, who\u2019s realized that they\u2019ve got competition. So, we\u2019re looking at early days of them very rapidly improving the quality of search and adding a ton of new features that will be awesome to see in the next two years. I\u2019ve made a prediction on Twitter. I said \u201cwatch this space, Google\u2019s activated, they\u2019re about to do amazing things. If it doesn\u2019t happen within two years, you come back to this tweet and call me out.\u201d You know, I\u2019m fine with being accountable for it. So that\u2019s Google. Definitely amazing things will come out of their engineering teams now that they\u2019re allowed to do amazing things again. So that\u2019s great. Amazing things will come out of SEO as well because we\u2019ve been enabled with a phenomenal amount of technology and tools to support our workflows. So, everyone who has an appetite for innovation and building things and streamlining things can do that now. And that puts us in an interesting position where the expected output from a typical SEO is a lot higher. And I don\u2019t know if that\u2019s a good or bad thing, but our clients will expect more and more from us and a higher level of work. Which is fine with me. I\u2019m comfortable with what\u2019s going on. Spent the last two years or 2+ years studying machine learning all across and couldn\u2019t be more excited about SEO. From just a bit of background, around 2013 when my daughter was born, I went into kind of a semi-retirement, because SEO was boring. Same old things. Right? Technical SEO, keyword research, competitive research, a bit of link building content, schema local SEO. So now things are really fun and I do these crazy, you know, 14-, 15-hour days. Just feel like it\u2019s, I feel like it\u2019s 2006 again. It\u2019s fantastic. Garrett : I love that. You are a tinkerer, a builder, an experimenter, and it kind of leads right into this next phase of search, which is conversational search. The way that people are interacting and actually searching on ChatGPT. For your presentation at SEO Week, you are really going to tackle this next phase, which is how do you monitor brand representation in LLMs. Can you kind of give me a summary of what people would get excited about from what you plan to share with us? Dan:  Yeah. Well, I\u2019ve been planning to implement this for the last six months. The idea popped up quite organically within our teams. Like, okay, so AI overview started and then, you know, people are discovering. And at the time we thought, you know, ChatGPT is for geeks and, but now we\u2019re seeing it integrated, you know, Gemini is integrated in Android. Apple\u2019s got the deal with open AI. Things are happening. Perplexity is big. And it\u2019s quite obvious that yes, there\u2019s Google, but people are discovering brands, products, services, learning about new things and concepts and people. If your brand or name is constantly mentioned in the context of something, you will become an authority. It\u2019s like a self-perpetuating prophecy, but you will become an authority in that. It\u2019s a huge thing for somebody to be promoted in AI answers. So, there\u2019s two levels. One is the core memory, the knowledge, the neural network just spits out your brand or your name as an answer because it\u2019s innate. It\u2019s inbuilt coming from the training data. And there\u2019s a various levels of fine tuning, knowledge updates, retrieval, augmented generation, basically using external data sources to feed the large language model to give those results. My job right now is to study all that, analyze what works, what doesn\u2019t work. And I feel like there\u2019s a lot of things to do right now. And we might, you know, in five years time, we might not be able to influence these things as easily. But right now, fertile ground for manipulation, for hacking, for tweaking. So it feels so, you know, 2005, 2006. And I think now is the time to do that stuff. But you know, influencing is one part, of course, measuring is another. So we need to understand when somebody types in a query or a product or service, you know, we want to understand how frequently does a brand or product or a name come up in those answers. And the issue is that there\u2019s so many models right now. And how do you get a balanced overview of what\u2019s going on? Luckily, we have this mentality of rank tracking. So we kind of, you know, we know how that works. You know, you\u2019ve got a query and then you have the rank tracker up and down. And so, for each query or a concept, you can have the representation percentage and have that sort of like, you know, the track of ups and downs, which we see in the rank trackers. So, I\u2019m hoping to have that and I\u2019m hoping to have a score that I can give to a single score that I can give to my clients in the report that says \u201cyour representation, overall representation score is 38%. Last month, it was 35%. We\u2019re doing well. We\u2019re going up.\u201d It\u2019s a little bit of a dumbed down factor, but I think people like a single score, a single metric, DAPA, PageRank, this, that. And I think it\u2019s going to catch on if I\u2019m, you know, persistent with it enough. Obviously tracking is a technical challenge. So, we\u2019ll need to use some trickery. Obviously we can\u2019t tap into actual queries of people in their chats. So we\u2019ll have to use, you know, things like synthetic data and querying of the models. You know, you know, those when, in China, they have those swipe phone farms and you just do like a lot of interactions on TikTok and you know, this and that. I might have something of that type without an actual physical form. I might have like a couple of hundred instances of something querying models all the time. For all the, maybe even something on API from, from a search console, querying top 5% of all the most important queries for my clients. And then monitoring those automatically without too much manual setup. So scaling up, understanding of representation, is what I\u2019m busy with right now. I doubt that I will have this as a problem solved by April. But I will, I will have surely some really solid frameworks and prototypes ready to share and excite people with. Garrett : That\u2019s so cool. And to your point, it\u2019s like people want that, that share voice, that market share perspective for as consumer search behavior changes and they use these tools for search. Executive need, you know, major clients, businesses need a way to report on that and ways to show up. What is a tactic that someone, you know, whether you are an enterprise or a small business right now could use to, in this like ecosystem of chatbots and LLMs, to improve visibility or monitor visibility? Dan:  So if you ask that, you know, a regular Joe, they\u2019ll say, you know, do digital PR, generate buzz around your brand. And that\u2019s, that\u2019s a fair answer. You know, I\u2019ll say, I\u2019ll, I\u2019ll jump on the bandwagon and I\u2019ll say the same thing. Obviously if there\u2019s a lot of chat about your brand discussions and you\u2019re in the news and notability, you will surely pop up. But, you know, I, like I mentioned earlier, this is the hacker days, manipulated days, you know, like, so I\u2019m going to say one thing, getting to training data, getting to training data. How do you do that? That\u2019s why I need to catch up on all this geekery and jargon that we use in machine learning space. What\u2019s hugging, what\u2019s hugging face? What\u2019s data sets, training data sets. What are the training data sets for? Well, you use training data sets that are free and open source, and I can generate a training data set synthetically using a model like Gemma. In fact, I have one that\u2019s maybe a hundred megabytes already big because I just go on holidays and my computers are churning training data, just generating synthetic training data. So, I upload that to hugging face or other, you know, Kaggle and other platforms. And what do you know? My client seems to be represented a little bit more than just a little bit in there. And my training data is saying good things about them, not necessarily good things, but like associating my client\u2019s brand name with the things that they do and the things that we want. So I doubt that OpenAI will pick up that data set and train their models on it, but the little models will. And then, one thing like, you know, they get amalgamated and merged and joined and they make models and distilled. So you always find value in that. And I don\u2019t know, it\u2019s not to say that they wouldn\u2019t, but I\u2019m saying give it every chance to get in there. So for example, DeepSeek wasn\u2019t trained on like the billion dollar budget. They would have used small data sets from Hugging Face for sure, guaranteed, to generate, you know, and structure their own reinforcement learning data sets and everything else. So if you happen to be, now that ship has sailed, DeepSeek\u2019s out, but you know, any future little innovations like that, you could, you know, get jackpot and end up in the training of that model and be the foundational element of it. That\u2019s, I think, pretty exciting. So that\u2019s the kind of stuff that I do and think about these days while things are still quite in development, that we can influence it early on. Garrett : I love that. And so much of this is like, you know, getting visibility in the near future, but also thinking the far future, like what is the big question? What\u2019s the next chapter of search? What does search look like to you? What\u2019s the next iteration? Whether it\u2019s Google or just any search behavior? Dan:  Well, the next logical step is my agent will talk to your agent and they\u2019ll figure things out. So, I think in a sense, search will be, it will be as important to influence the robots as it will be important to influence humans these days. So how do you influence somebody\u2019s, I mean, in Australia, we don\u2019t have operator yet. It\u2019s only limited to the US. And I think those who are paying $200 a month for the premium subscription. But that\u2019s early days of\u2026I think this is very hacky at the moment, like the operator or the agent is \u00a0just going clicking on things randomly, missing buttons and making little mistakes. That\u2019s all nice and cute right now. But soon enough, I think we\u2019re going to see the true value of structured data and good solid foundation websites and good SEO. When one website is just, an agent can go through it and figure things out and the taxonomy is clear and there\u2019s product schema on it and everything is great and then you\u2019ve got this hot mess of a website that nobody knows what\u2019s going on and the breadcrumbs are different from taxonomy and there\u2019s no, actually there\u2019s no taxonomy and the product naming conventions are different. So you\u2019ve got a non-SEO website and you\u2019ve got an SEO website. So SEO hygiene now becomes influence for robots. And I think that\u2019s pretty exciting, because we just went full circle. We went from hacking Google to focus what\u2019s best for the user and now we\u2019re back to it. Now with influencing robots again. Although we just call them, what do we call them? Agents or operators or whatever. So I think that\u2019s the next chapter in SEO being influencing the machines. I find that pretty exciting. Of course, we still have the bread and butter of what we do is still human work, because ultimately what the agent brings to the human will be the deciding factor to how they act on that information. I think the days of people sending an agent to buy somebody an item and then come back, I think that\u2019s a little bit too far off for now. I think it\u2019ll be more like, okay, go find me the best options and then people make the final judgment. And the final judgment will be made on the product quality, product image quality and the description and everything that comes with that. The quality of information that\u2019s assembled and brought to you as a user is only as good as what you put into it. So there\u2019s a lot of value for us as an industry to contribute to the web ecosystem. Garrett : There you go. There\u2019s a lot to process. Thank you so much. It\u2019s such fascinating stuff. Like we geek out over this stuff because like you said, it is one of the most exciting times in search and machine learning and the development of this tech.

My name is Garrett Sussman and I am joined by none other than Devin Bramhall. She is the Growth Advisor and podcast host of Don\u2019t Say Content. She\u2019s writing a frickin book and she\u2019s joined us with 35+ other amazing presenters for SEO Week, which is April 28 to May 2 in New York City. If you haven\u2019t got your tickets yet, go get them right now. Devin, thank you for joining me. What is going on? Devin : Hi, everything is going on and I think I\u2019m not the only one that feels that way. Just you know, it\u2019s that typical start of the year when things are really slow and it first kicks off and everyone\u2019s like, wow, I think this is the year that I\u2019m going to be organized. I\u2019m going to start my routines and like halfway through January, all of that goes to shit because everybody\u2019s brain comes back online and they\u2019re like, oh, I\u2019ve got to get and then you\u2019re like, oh, and so the trickle-down effect right to everyone. Like, and I remember this from Animals too. It was just like first few weeks out of the year, you\u2019re like, \u201chello??\u201d And then all of a sudden you\u2019re like\u2026 Garrett : And to that point, it\u2019s like also in this context, there\u2019s so much noise. There feels like there\u2019s so much happening in our world of marketing right now just to kind of dive right in. What is your perspective on everything that\u2019s going on in the world of search and SEO, especially like from, from a content marketing perspective, what\u2019s it look like? Devin : I, my, I feel like nothing\u2019s happening. Okay. I feel like there\u2019s a lot of people talking and nothing is actually happening! And I\u2019ve felt that way for a while where there\u2019s this like constant feed of SEO news, let\u2019s say an algorithm update, a like thing that somebody figured out that may have been like all that stuff. It\u2019s just constant. And then there are people doing the work. Like there are people who are actually like, there\u2019s the content marketers doing search content and all of that. Um, same goes with AI, right? There\u2019s like, \u201cOh my God, AI is going to ruin everybody\u2019s job. And it\u2019s going to take all your content! And look, there\u2019s a tool that says you can track how much is a\u2026\u201d right? And then you\u2019ve got the people using AI to do content marketing, right? And I feel like when you get onto the, when you get to like the work, it\u2019s all the same. Like people are still writing for search there, uh, or content marketers rather. They\u2019re still looking at, you know, the sort of long tail keyword opportunity as an entr\u00e9e into a more saturated, um, space. There\u2019s still like, I don\u2019t even think the structure of posts have changed all that much either. And they\u2019re still using AI and nothing\u2019s exploding or imploding. It\u2019s just\u2026right? They\u2019re just learning how to incorporate it into their workflow and use it better. And so, when I take a step back and I look at the past year, okay, 2024, let\u2019s say I\u2019m like, so we\u2019re still doing content marketing exactly the way we were before with a slight tweak, uh, using live with generative AI, um, that will probably increase in its like positive supporting impact over time. Once we like learn how to use it better. Um, there\u2019s the early adopters. There\u2019s the, we\u2019re kind of in that mid-phase, right? There\u2019s the laggards. We\u2019re all like, \u201cI\u2019m a content marketer and technology is bad for creativity\u201d and like whatever, everything is the fucking same! Nothing has changed at all. I go to companies, I\u2019m working with a company right now. I am doing marketing strategy, like using the same components, a bit more media, right? So to me, nothing has changed with regards to content marketing and search, the thing that has changed is that the way we\u2019re executing is, is, has flipped. So now instead of starting with the blog posts or starting with the keyword strategy, you\u2019re starting with a video and then atomizing it outwards, right. So we\u2019re more efficient. Um, there is like, I think the media piece is going to only continue to be a more part of a B2B content marketing strategy, but search on those specific platforms is really helpful for making those new tactics work. And so that to me is like, if you go platform to platform and how they\u2019re behaving like TikTok, YouTube, um, wherever else it\u2019s like, they\u2019re actually becoming more sophisticated in how they can help businesses show up to specific audiences. And so it\u2019s like, there\u2019s a benefit over here, but all the things that people are screaming about, I\u2019m like, if you took a step back, can you point to any money, like a change in how much money is being made or how much people are being paid? No. Garrett : No. That is so on point. I mean, to your point, it\u2019s like videos more accessible, but there are different channels, but everything, the fundamentals are still the same. People are still people, and they use what they want to use, which kind of leads into\u2026can you give a preview? So why, why the heck are people going to come in and see you speak at SEO week? What are you going to educate us on? Devin : Oh man, my talk. So first of all, Jay Acunzo is a good friend of mine and I hired him to help me with the keynote because I\u2019m doing, it\u2019s going to be the keynote, the basis for all my talks through this year when I\u2019m selling the book, right. And to no surprise, anyone who knows me, the theme that like this, all this sort of premise all boiled up to one thing. And I think this thing will really resonate with the folks at SEO Week, which is, \u201cstop doing marketing.\u201d And the reason \u2013 \u00a0I know! I\u2019m a marketer telling marketers, I\u2019m like, \u201cyou need to stop doing marketing. You need to start achieving business outcomes.\u201d And when you flip your focus like that, right? Like marketers were used to production equaling impact, equaling revenue, right? If you were to take all of that out and say, okay, my company wants to get from point A revenue to point B revenue by the end of the year. And here are the milestones by quarter. Okay. It\u2019s Q1. I\u2019m responsible for impacting this much revenue or this many like MQLs as like whatever your fricking metric is, right? Like for your company. Okay. The question should be, how are we going to get those? But the question has been for years is what marketing do we need to do to get those and beat people\u2019s consumption behavior? Their buying behavior not only has changed slightly, but it\u2019s also going to continue to change when you think about we\u2019ve got a new buyer coming to the market, just Gen Z. Well, they\u2019re operating on a completely different paradigm. And so, for me, if you were like take removing marketing from the scenario and saying, how are you going to help a company grow opens your mind up to new possibilities that maybe you didn\u2019t consider if you\u2019re only thinking within the paradigm of marketing. So that\u2019s the gist of it. It\u2019s look, I can tell you, I can, I can tell you this. It\u2019s based on multimedia, obviously AI for efficiency. This is like the thing everybody already knows, right? And community building. Like that\u2019s been a cornerstone of my career everywhere I\u2019ve went and it works every single time. It\u2019s how I took Animalz from 1.8 to 12 million in three years, right. It\u2019s like every HelpScout, same thing. It is the solution. It\u2019s actually, it\u2019s a strategy that I think doesn\u2019t always get recognized for how genius it can be. Like with HelpScout, it was like we made one, we made this thing called HelpYou, which was basically like bringing in community, content, product, the customer service team, like, and there was all like a PR strategy, a demand gen strategy, gating things, not like\u2026the whole thing, right. It was like, that was going to be the next generation of their business model. You know, had I had time to see it through. But yeah, so I think that\u2019s where I\u2019m going with this. I\u2019m like, let\u2019s stop doing marketing and let\u2019s start coming up with like clever, clever plans to grow that aren\u2019t about doing more. It\u2019s about achieving more, hopefully by doing less and only doing the smart things. Garrett : I love it. It\u2019s so relevant because there\u2019s such a fight, especially like on LinkedIn or SaaS marketers about attribution and performance marketing, and then bringing it back to everything so much more holistic. And we hear more talking about brand and you get so up in the clouds about everything, but it\u2019s like what you\u2019re talking about is like actually focused on strategy that ties to the business value. So, what\u2019s one like, what is one practical thing that people can do today, right now, based on the direction that you think everything\u2019s going? Devin : Yeah. I mean, the first thing I would do is clear, like to even start doing this, you have to clear the decks. You have to say, like, take all of this, like brand, customer journey, like throw it all in the trash can. Start with who are you trying to sell to? Where are they? Where are they? Were they showing up for fun? Where are they showing up to create community? Where are they showing up? And don\u2019t worry about\u2026like, just anywhere they\u2019re showing up. It doesn\u2019t have to be like, oh, this is where everyone is. Like really try to do that audit of like where there might be like subreddits over here with like a portion of them, right? And look at what they\u2019re talking about. Like this is the fundamentals of content marketing. So like, I can\u2019t say the other stuff yet because my publishers will kill me, but like, this is very much like, I\u2019m like, let\u2019s go back to the basics of content marketing and help people. And so what you need to do to help them is go figure out exactly where they are, figure out exactly what they need and see where the holes are. Where are the holes? Where are they not getting something? And it doesn\u2019t\u2026and again, because we\u2019re not thinking in terms of marketing anymore, it doesn\u2019t have to be where are they not getting education? Where are they not getting a product? Where are they not getting? Just what is missing? Where are they like, oh yeah, I really wish we had a blah, blah, blah, blah, or you know, or stuff that they\u2019re not even asking for. Where you\u2019re like, \u201coh wait, like looking at what they\u2019re talking about, like this thing over here would solve all of their problems or they would love to join it,\u201d right? So, you have to like play for them and really start with this blank slate mindset because I think that you have to start there to start coming up with good ideas, right. And what\u2019s happens for me is like that I come up with a lot of ideas, right. But given the constraints of the business goals, right. They want to get rev, like they want to get revenue from here to here. Okay. Short term, I have to at least make sure that this hits my quarterly target, right. That also helps like narrow down the options of what you can do. So does your budget. So does your team. So team size, et cetera, like all your resources and what you find at the end of that, and I kid you not, is an answer just sitting there. It\u2019s like once you add the\u2026like, once you put everything out there and then you use your constraints, like all of a sudden the constraints of where your people are, who they are, what they want, what\u2019s missing, what your budget also, all of a sudden you\u2019re like, oh, so if I just do like a paid LinkedIn campaign and like, you know, you\u2019re like, you know, start this newsletter over here talking about this nerdy stuff, like you could probably do  three  things, and one of them, I guarantee, involves you making money off the content thing itself. And that is like, that would be my like second, second thing is like everyone, every company should be making money off their content program in some way right now. And if they\u2019re not, they\u2019re doing it wrong. Like there\u2019s so many ways to monetize content now. Like, why can\u2019t brands do it too? Right. So that\u2019s the, that\u2019s the amount that I can share today and more to come. Garrett : It\u2019s so good. And it\u2019s basically, you broke down, it\u2019s like really nice framework of like these three cons it\u2019s like context, constraints and content. And really that is the direction. No, it\u2019s really clear the way you laid out. Finally, I know we\u2019re almost at time, but I want to know, you know, you, you mentioned like the fractured nature of community, the upcoming Gen Z. What\u2019s next? What do you think is next when it comes to the search ecosystem? Where are going to people going to find their education, their entertainment, all of these things and how will that change? Devin : I\u2026look, I\u2019m not like a tech, you know, forecaster, but I think that this, um, we\u2019ll continue to see the kind of breakup into niche communities, right. And even communities within platforms, it\u2019s like that just looking at the culture right now and how people are acting, um, and the choices they\u2019re making, I just don\u2019t see logically how all of a sudden that\u2019s, it\u2019s going to change such that like we all join the same platform and can coexist again, right. So, I think that\u2019s just like, everyone should assume that for logical reasons. And I think that like, as it relates to search, I don\u2019t know. I\u2019ve been pretty excited about both what AI and search are doing or are the, the, um, like the big changes that are happening, you know, that everyone\u2019s freaking out about like the, the, the SERPs page, like, \u201cOh, you\u2019re getting all the answers right there, it\u2019s a mix of like AI and links and videos and community\u2026\u201d I\u2019m like, that sounds cool. It just feels like we\u2019re in the middle of the transition. Like we\u2019re in that figuring it out phase. And so I\u2019m actually really excited and I actually have no idea what it ends up looking at, like, but I like what, where it\u2019s going. And I think that Google isn\u2019t dumb. So, they\u2019re not going to experiment with stuff that\u2019s going to tank their search business, right. And so, they\u2019re going to find a way for companies to still find it useful for them to still be able to, you know, do paid search and all that stuff. So like, I\u2019m not really worried about that. I\u2019m more curious to see what they come up with. Because that\u2019s a place where I can\u2019t imagine, right. I can\u2019t imagine that\u2019s there. Like that\u2019s their area of expertise. I can only say that like, it\u2019s, it has, it inevitably has to continue changing based on the fact that like, uh, the buyers are changing and behaviors are changing around content consumption and media is only going to be more and more of a piece of that pie. And so like, they\u2019re going to do something about it. And I can\u2019t wait to see what that is. Garrett : I love it. And I love, you know, you, you tied it back to revenue. It\u2019s like with Google. And I say this all the time too. It\u2019s like, follow the money, you know, see where the revenue is coming from, how it will be impacted in terms of their innovation. This is going to be an awesome conference. I can\u2019t wait to hear your presentation. I can\u2019t wait to read your book, when it\u2019s out and you\u2019re doing your, your global world intergalactic tour, who knows where you\u2019ll end up. Devin : Oh my God. Literally produced and PR\u2019d by myself. I\u2019m like, that is, yeah! Garrett : You got to, you got to get out there and do the thing. Well, thank you so much for joining me, Devin, for those of you who haven\u2019t gotten tickets yet for SEO Week, catch us seriously tickets, April 28th, New York. Come chill with us.

I\u2019m Garrett Sussman. This is hosted by SEO Week and iPullRank. If you haven\u2019t already gotten tickets, we\u2019re talking the end of April, the 28th to May 1st. We\u2019ve got 35+ amazing speakers across SEO, AI, business, digital strategy, content, you name it. It\u2019s going to be a jam-packed, highly valuable event. So get your tickets at seoweek.org. Today I am joined by Tom Critchlow. Tom is the EVP of Audience Growth at Raptive. Thank you for joining me today, Tom. How you doing, man? Tom : Yeah, thanks for having me here. It\u2019s good to chat. Garrett : I\u2019m excited. I\u2019m really excited for your presentation. But before we dive into that, the big talk is right now, the last 24 months of SEO has been disruptive fundamentally. From your perspective, where do we stand in the current state of SEO? \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Tom : It\u2019s like how long we got? We got a couple of hours of talks! I think the number one feature for me is the rise of AI. And obviously there\u2019s a number of different ways to skin that. AI is changing our workflows, it\u2019s changing fundamentally the way that we do our jobs day to day. But I think specifically around SEO, the rise of AI content is just completely upended the dynamics of the web. Where before low-quality content, auto-generated content was somehow kind of like throttled or kind of bottlenecked by this kind of quality filter. And then AI came along and what we call AI today is really like large language models that enable content that was finally good enough, right? Finally passed some floor of like, you can\u2019t actually quite tell whether a human or a computer wrote this. And I think you can trace all the helpful content updates, all of the big core algorithm updates from Google over the last couple of years, all the way back to that kind of like just train wreck of under the hood. Google systems just almost overnight just suddenly stopped working. Their ability to be like, \u201cOh, we know what\u2019s good content, we know what\u2019s bad content.\u201d And then suddenly it was just like flooding the zone with all of this terrible, terrible content. In some ways, although the helpful content updates have been a train wreck, in some ways they got handed to Google that I think they reacted quickly, right? And early, right when I think it wasn\u2019t necessarily prevalent in the mainstream conversation around AI content and all of the kind of like scale that it was at. I think Google saw the writing on the wall earlier than most and kind of like tried to get in front of that. As we\u2019ve seen though, rebuilding your ranking system fairly fundamentally has like not come without its challenges, right? We\u2019ve seen all the helpful content updates and stuff the last couple of years is just people that didn\u2019t deserve to have had their livelihoods taken away. Sites that have no business ranking and would never have ranked and kind of classic Google kind of terms all over the SERPs. I think Lily Ray in particular has done a great job just kind of like highlighting and articulating the degree to which everyday search results are just demonstrably worse than they used to be in a variety of ways. So yeah, I don\u2019t think you can talk about the state of search without talking about just kind of AI content. Garrett : Yeah, and it\u2019s funny because it\u2019s like not funny, but like with Raptive, like that\u2019s a whole big part of your mission statement is like, creator first, making sure that content is authentic, like not anti-AI, but also not necessarily like let slop take over. What do you think, you know, does good content, a good Google search product look like? Tom : Yeah, yeah. I think that the fundamental unit of good quality content is less about the actual content itself, right, which I think is increasingly becoming in some sense of the commodity is certainly for certain kinds of searches and certain kinds of content, and more about the connection that you have with that content, right. And so whether it is the author or the creator or the influencer or the brand that created it, or whether it\u2019s the engagement you have with it, commenting, rating, discussing, sharing, and so on. And I think that what we see with AI content is it doesn\u2019t really meet either of those needs, like you\u2019re not engaging with it, and you don\u2019t care who made it. Now that\u2019s fine for certain kinds of queries, right? Like what time is the Super Bowl? You know, classically, it\u2019s kind of a, you know, canary in the coal mine. It\u2019s like, I don\u2019t need a publisher to write that piece of content. It\u2019s fine, Google can just answer that. I don\u2019t think anyone really has a problem with that. But you know, certainly talking about my day job, right, working at Raptive, we work with a lot of creators, a lot of food creators in particular. Recipe search is a great example where I think on the face of it, you could argue that just give me the recipe, right? Just give me the ingredients list. But when you look at creative, when you look at user behavior, and when you look at what people actually want and what they actually engage with, it\u2019s the step-by-step photos. It\u2019s the author\u2019s kind of like brand and personality and tone of voice. It\u2019s the ability to comment and share and like, you know, engage with the recipe. And AI can replace certain parts of the kind of the pure information needs, but it isn\u2019t doing a very good job of replacing the other piece. And so, to answer your question more directly that you already asked about, like, what does a good search result look like is, in my mind, I think AI should be doing a better job of surfacing the right voices that meet your query rather than trying to answer it for you. Now, again, that\u2019s not in all cases, there are some situations like what\u2019s happened at the Super Bowl, just answer the question. But I think in many cases, Google has, I mean, everyone has, but Google in particular has kind of conflated those two need states of like, information efficiency isn\u2019t the only game for many, many queries. Now I will give Google a little bit of credit. I actually think that if folks here are kind of paying attention to the recipe space in particular, recipes and shopping are two of the only verticals that have the new AI-organized search results kind of view. And I actually think that\u2019s like, not a \u2013 like a kind of positive step in the right direction in some senses, right? It\u2019s not without its flaws. But the idea that AI can say, oh, you want to find taco recipes? If you look on desktop stills for taco recipes, you only see beef tacos, right? It\u2019s like, they\u2019re all just beef tacos. If you look on mobile and you get the AI organized, it\u2019s like, what do you want? Fish tacos, veggie tacos, beef tacos, like, it actually gives you a range of options. But it\u2019s pointing you to individual recipes, individual creators that you might know and recognize and so on. I think that\u2019s kind of like in my mind where I hope things go more in that direction. As we increasingly have some of those like, raw information needs met by AI, at the same time, at the same time, AI should be surfacing and connecting you to diverse voices, a broad range of things and that kind of like, the ability to find what you want, which is again, Google\u2019s mission, kind of more easily. Garrett : Yeah, and it\u2019s an unfair question on my end too, because it\u2019s like, we always try to generalize or simplify the world of SEO, but every industry, every type of query is different. And it\u2019s much more complex of a question. I think you give a really great perspective on what is valuable across the board while not like undercutting the nuance of how difficult it is across different SEO teams for individual companies, which kind of leads me into your talk, which is the business side of SEO. Can you really speak to what you plan on presenting at SEO week that people are going to get excited about? Tom : Yeah, for sure. I believe this with every fiber of my being that the number one challenge that every SEO professional faces is not AI, it is not how to crawl websites or web pages at scale, it is not keywords, it is not which software tool to use, it is how do you gain confidence in SEO as a channel with the executives of your organization, right? Executive communication is a skill set that is hard to learn. Nobody teaches you and is fiercely valuable, right? And so I\u2019ve kind of been on a bit of a mission over the last, I mean, I guess, honestly, kind of my whole career in some senses, but specifically since I launched the SEO MBA back in, what if that was 2021, my mission has been about connecting the dots between what happens behind closed doors in the executive team and how SEO teams and SEO professionals can better prepare themselves and advocate for their own work. And I saw that working for myself as a consultant for 10 years, I got a peek into so many different teams and organizations and setups and often was kind of the person that straddled both worlds where I was in the executive team in those meetings, but also working with the SEO team and kind of like just understanding that disconnect, just the vast, vast disconnect of language, metrics, of strategy, of the way that these SEO teams are trying to advocate for themselves and just the failure of that communication up to the executive team. And so what I want to talk about at SEO Week is both some kind of concrete tactical things, but also a bit of a philosophical approach that you can take to, how do we turn SEO into a more measurable channel? How do you turn SEO into a thing that executive stakeholders can understand and have confidence within? And ultimately, how can you get a better job? Because that\u2019s what it really comes down to is like, if you can advocate for yourself and for the channel at the executive levels, then surprise, that\u2019s the gateway to senior roles, right? And so, by far and away, the most popular post I ever wrote on the SEO MBA newsletter was this kind of, like, career kind of roadmap and like the skillset that you need for different careers. And you just can\u2019t get to those senior roles without executive communication skills. And so that\u2019s kind of the piece that I want to evangelize and get real nerdy about at SEO week. And I don\u2019t know why I get so passionate about this, but it really lights me up. And I think it\u2019s the thing that, again, I\u2019ve just seen so many SEO professionals just, it\u2019s difficult to learn, right? And nobody will sit you down and teach you to, right? It\u2019s one of those kind of arcane skills that feels like black magic from the outside, a little bit like SEO, ironically, to folks that aren\u2019t practitioners. And so my goal, my aim is to try to demystify that and try to help folks out. Garrett : It\u2019s one of the presentations I\u2019m most excited about. I think it\u2019s one of the most critically important conversations that SEOs need to think career-wise in this economic situation that we\u2019re in with so much uncertainty going forward across corporations. Like if there\u2019s one skill set beyond the hard skills is the soft skills that can save your career, save your family going forward. You mentioned a bunch of practical takeaways. What\u2019s one that someone can start doing right now if they\u2019re in that spot thinking about their presence in these executive rooms? Tom : Yeah, I mean, two very, very immediate concrete things that I\u2019d suggest. One is \u2013 \u00a0care more about your reporting, right? One of my favorite subject lines that I wrote as part of the SEO MBA was, \u201cYour boss cares more about reporting than you do.\u201d No matter how much you care about it, your boss cares more. Reporting is your gateway to behavior change, advocacy, buy-in, budget, getting stakeholders on your side. Everything is downstream of having good reporting. And so, no matter how much you think you\u2019ve worked on reporting or no matter how much you think it\u2019s in a good spot, make it better, care more about it. And that isn\u2019t just caring about the data in it, but also the presentation, the communication, et cetera. And as part of that reporting suite, my second kind of concrete practical tip is fall down a rabbit hole learning about input metrics. That\u2019s actually going to be a kind of, I think, a big part of the talk that I give at SEO Week is, you\u2019ve got to radically reframe from reporting on things that have happened, which is like page views and rankings and clicks and traffic, and shifting to reporting on things that are changing behavior. So it\u2019s like, \u201cWe have done  this . We have done  this .\u201d And we believe those things will lead to future growth. And what you learn as you get kind of higher up inside organizations is that reporting on what has happened is like, it\u2019s kind of table stakes, but it\u2019s not very valuable. It\u2019s like, \u201cSure, you need to know that.\u201d But it has zero predictive power for what\u2019s going to happen next. And the more time you spend executively, the more you understand that. What executives want to understand is what are we doing now that drives future growth? What are we doing now that drives future performance? And if you don\u2019t have a point of view on that in your reporting, if your reporting is only reporting on what has happened, you\u2019re basically already dead in the water. You\u2019re basically already sidelined as far as the executive team goes. So anyway, I told you I\u2019d get excited about it. I\u2019ll talk more about that at SEO Week. So, come watch my presentation if you\u2019re into it. Garrett : No, I\u2019m excited. And it segues perfectly into, we were talking earlier about this changing nature of search, the input of AI. And as you\u2019re trying to steer, be a steward of your organization in the right direction, reporting accurately with these inputs, you have to be paying attention to the direction that we\u2019re going and how consumer behavior is changing. What\u2019s your perspective on what\u2019s next in terms of SEO, search, AI going forward? Tom : I think Google said it best, right? Buckle up. I think\u2026I don\u2019t have a crystal ball, I can\u2019t tell you what\u2019s next\u2026I think we\u2019re in for a year of pretty dramatic change on Google\u2019s side in particular. They\u2019re facing pressures left, right, and center, not least from ChatGPT. If I had to pontificate or make some wild conjectures, I think that we\u2019ll see a lot more AI-organized search results. Getting us out of the mold of just thinking about AI overviews, like a thing that is at the top of the page, but I think we\u2019ll see much more radical full page AI takeovers in whatever that means for different kinds of queries. I also think that at some point in 2025, there will be a fundamental shift in the UX of a follow-up question. I think honestly one of the biggest innovations for ChatGPT is that you could just ask a follow-up. You can just say, \u201cWell, I asked for a certain piece of information. I did some research and now I want to know more. I want to go further. I want to go sideways.\u201d Search as a UX paradigm fundamentally doesn\u2019t let you do that. I think the very early versions of AI overviews had that embedded in them with a chat interface, but I think that we\u2019ll see Google try and innovate again around that follow-up question and persistent thread of follow-through. Just to give a little background for fun context. I worked at Google over a decade ago now. When I was there last time around, I was involved in a project where we were trying to understand whether we could actually understand what the user\u2019s intent was across multiple queries. The answer was no. There was basically this massive research project that I was only lightly involved in, but I was there for the readout and the TL;DR was a bunch of smart Google engineers spent a bunch of time trying to figure out if they could understand the intent of a user across multiple queries and the answer was no. The answer now is yes. That is a pretty fundamental change to the way that search just works under the hood of query response. If I had to guess the 2025, it\u2019s obviously more AI and something more conversational, I think, is coming. Garrett : Oh my gosh. Thanks so much. I\u2019m so excited. You should definitely get your tickets if you haven\u2019t already. To that point, it\u2019s really hard to have this conversation with someone who, when we both geek out about this, because I want to go and talk for half an hour about everything that you just said. Yeah, check it out, SEOweek.org. Tom Critchlow will be talking all about the inputs and everything that you can do to upscale your career as an SEO and so much more. I mean, we\u2019ll be able to all have conversations at this intimate gathering. Thank you so much for joining me, Tom. This is going to be awesome. Tom : Appreciate it, Garrett. Garrett : It\u2019s been a lot of fun. My name is Garrett. I\u2019m brought to you by SEO Week and iPullRank. We will see you in April, I hope.

Remember, if you haven\u2019t already gotten your tickets, we\u2019re talking about New York City, the end of April, the 28th to May 1st. It\u2019s going to be dynamic four days of action-packed presentations from 35 of the most respected expert speakers all over the world. We\u2019re international. We\u2019re talking SEO, AI, data, content, and I am so excited to be joined today by the prolific, the one and only, she is Aleyda Solis, international SEO consultant and founder of Orainti, but she also does SEO FOMO, learningseo.io, so many different hubs across the internet where you can learn all about SEO. Thank you for joining me today, Aleyda. How are you doing? Aleyda : Very, very good. And even better now talking with you. It\u2019s always a pleasure, of course. Thank you very much for having me. And I am so very excited also for the SEO week. I cannot wait. Garrett : It\u2019s going to be, I mean, the lineup is just so many old familiar faces and a lot of new friends that are going to be coming and dropping knowledge. And these conversations are so hard. I\u2019m like, before this, I\u2019m like, we\u2019re going to talk for 10 to 15 minutes. But when you and I start talking about SEO and what\u2019s happening in our industry, it\u2019s so hard to limit it. But I\u2019m going to jump in. The state of SEO in a nutshell, where do we currently stand from your perspective? Aleyda : It\u2019s very exciting times. I believe that I haven\u2019t lived through all of the changes and new things and areas to learn since I started in the industry, right? And which, like at that time, everything seemed new. Probably it wasn\u2019t necessarily, but for me, right, because I was learning. Right now, every single week at this point, there is a new tool that allows you to assess your brand visibility in a lens, for example, or identify citation sources or another one that is a new SEO agent to support you for content optimization, for example. And it\u2019s very exciting times, I believe, and allow us to, I think, that push for the level of sophistication that SEO really was already needing anyway, since way a long time ago. And potentially, since we have now a new competitor, a new platform that definitely shows the importance of it, we can realistically push it further. But yes, these are 100% exciting times. And every new week with SEO FOMO, I\u2019m like, oh my God, how do I summarize all of this? How I create like only the top 10? This is crazy. That is why I also started AI Marketers, the newsletter, where I only cover the AI application in marketing, which is pretty much, I have to say, like potentially 80% search, 20% content or something like that, pretty much. But yes, it\u2019s crazy and it\u2019s hectic indeed. Garrett : Regardless, I mean, it\u2019s SEO as an industry has matured so much and it really feels like it\u2019s at the center of so many marketing activities. And that\u2019s what you cover with AI Marketing and all the other different initiatives that you do. It makes it really ridiculous, especially with the daily changes we\u2019re seeing like ecommerce, which has really been your bread and butter. And I was wondering, you\u2019re going to kind of share so much of your insights into what\u2019s happening with e-commerce in your presentation. Can you give us a preview as to like why someone should come and see what you\u2019re going to share? Aleyda : Yeah, indeed. And funnily enough, I think that this is a topic that has been very overlooked as a trend overall in the industry. But I mean, for those who work in ecommerce, I believe that we know it, right? A lot that Google has become already a marketplace. The SERPs, the template links, goodbye, and this is the industry, I believe that this is much more evident than many, many others. And I have to say that this particular industry, and this is something that we were talking a bit about, I\u2019m fairly sure that it\u2019s not going to be displaced in any way anytime soon, but LLMs, just because of the type of information and integration and the product knowledge graph and merchant-centered data that Google has with so many retailers, online retailers, right? So for this sort of product-oriented, transactional, commercially-driven searches, I believe that Google will still be the platform even in the mid- to long term. And then now the challenge for an SEO, for those who focus on the optimization of online sources, how I keep my visibility and click-through rate and click-share as high as possible and maximize the opportunities in this new reality in which, above the fold, we see a product pack. That whenever you click one of the 10 results, it\u2019s a product knowledge panel. For many queries that just a couple of years ago, they were owned by the main category pages of major retailers and even brands, right? And a lot of brands also pretty much own the whole SERP. And now there\u2019s much more diversity, which ultimately, I believe, is effectively positive for the ultimate consumer at the end of the day, too. But yes, how many pages that are ranked in the positions feature thumbnails and also many more image packs in the positions that are clickable and ultimately show you image tab results that connect with PDPs to a lot of carousels that are connected with user-generated content and video content and guides and reviews. So for those that think that, \u201cOh, I am doing e-commerce, I\u2019m focusing on transactional categories, POP, PDPs, etc. I don\u2019t want informational content. They don\u2019t have visibility in the SERPs anymore.\u201d Not at all. So it\u2019s pretty exciting, exciting times indeed also for e-commerce for different reasons than the general trend in SEO, I have to say. And my talk is going to be about that, how you keep up and identify the opportunities given your scenario. I am doing actually a survey right now through SEO FOMO, the SEO FOMO ecommerce survey to gather data and insights, not only from my own experience, but from the experience of all of SEO FOMOers out there based on what they are seeing in their ecommerce-related SERPs on one hand. And then I\u2019m also doing a major study with a couple of SEO platforms out there to identify what is actually winning from an organic search visibility, clickability to traffic and the engagement that certain types of features tend to have across ecommerce, different ecommerce verticals, right? Again, AI overviews, the weight that these have and the importance of the role that these have in ecommerce is very, very different than from all the major industries too. So it will be very refreshing, I believe, and interesting to go through it, to share insights, hard data, and then a little bit of more input feedback from the experiences across the industries and to pretty much have an overview of the state of e-commerce nowadays and what we can expect next based on this trend that we\u2019re seeing and how we can do to win. Garrett : I can\u2019t wait. It\u2019s so exciting and it\u2019s so important to your point of like you, when you do such a good job of looking at the SERPs and identifying what is Google asking for? You did so much with like the PDPs and saying, when are those showing up? When are the images? And there\u2019s so much opportunity for brands who are paying attention and not just doing the same things like, yes, the fundamentals of SEO will always exist, but you can zero in on \u2013 another big thing that you talk about is like the revenue metrics and what\u2019s actually does lead to transactions, how you focus on it. What is one specific tactic that you\u2019ve been playing around with that someone can do right now for their ecommerce site that you think will be critical to their success? Aleyda:  There are a couple of things and it\u2019s true that a lot of visibility is now going and traffic is going to PDPs and I\u2019m going to cover that in a second, but a lot of brands and online stores, they follow this sort of rules to index, no index facets. And this is pretty static, many times. They did a keyword research back in the day and they saw that these sort of topics they don\u2019t get as many searches per month. It\u2019s not worth it to index them. They do have the product variety and offering to provide a good user experience to avoid cannibalizing, to avoid being flagged as not worthy to be indexed, but still they don\u2019t index them just because back in the day that this validation, this analysis, so my recommendation will be refresh that. It\u2019s like every, at least, at least every six months or so at the very least, you should be validating that because the search behavior of the user search changed a lot and the trends changed a lot and this is a really good proof and something that I have noticed and incentivize many clients to do so is just take a look at the Google sidebar, the filter sidebar for that is shown by Google now across so many product-related queries, which by the way, is also one of the, those elements that have been really detrimental in terms of click through rate for major head terms and have incentivized like the long tail for many of them. Why? Because people start playing with the different filters and categories and the characteristics right there, right? Like, so if Google has that colors available there or sizes or that literally, why are you not yet at least testing to index this, these pages? If you do have the offering, right? \u201cOh, it\u2019s because take a look, the only color that has more than a certain number of searches is black.\u201d It\u2019s like, \u201clook, even if it is only black, let\u2019s go ahead and test it, please. And let\u2019s see the impact towards the conversion for those products because you will literally provide a much better experience, right?\u201d That on one hand, so it\u2019s the typical supply and demand type of thing that we like solve problem with it, right? But not, not necessarily. Just look at the SERPs and take a look at the opportunities there and what Google is highlighting already there. So there\u2019s definitely that. And the other thing is the level of granularity that we tend to index PDP with color variation sizes again at the PDP level. Why Google is incentivizing the last year, Google pretty much spend the last year incentivizing ecommerce to start using structured data to detailed variations of products. Why? Because they want to surface more specific product pages through their product packs and the product knowledge panel. And we need to help them. We need to help them to showcase us more. And the way to do that is to start indexing them better, differentiating them better. The characteristics should be clearly showcased, of course, in the metadata and the descriptions and the review should be specific for each Q&A and the images, of course, to avoid content duplication issues and cannibalization issues. But then again, we can also now leverage also this structured data that Google has provided us to specify across them and make them easy, make them facilitate their lives to showcase us and surface our more specific PDPs much more prominently for those more long tail queries that we know that have started to grow more and more in the last few years. And it only continues to be growing. It\u2019s much more conversational, the search behavior that we\u2019re seeing for sure. Garrett : Exactly. It\u2019s such a good point and kind of leads into my next question, which is that this idea, if it\u2019s almost future thinking, future proofing your content, where it\u2019s like as search behavior changes because people realize that they can actually search for something super specific, like \u201crunning dad who hurt his back, who needs shoes to be able to run outdoors,\u201d we\u2019re going to see more queries like that. And if your content kind of speaks to that, you\u2019re more likely at that long tail grainy level to show up. So, speculation time, what do you think the future of ecommerce SEO is going to look like over the next few years? Aleyda:  I believe that we are going to end up getting this AI assistant sort of layer at the top of Google for many product-related queries. We already sort of like have been hinted at that with many of the AI related features that Google has been releasing, especially for mobile. So, to try it on, to personalize the experience much more. And eventually I believe that, yeah, that can end up becoming like a full-fledged assistant. Some people will call it agent, very sophisticated way, very focused on providing like the ultimate retail sales, online retail sales assistant of sorts. So, I can definitely see that. I truly believe that, well, you don\u2019t only need real time data. We know that this data changes all the time with retailers, like the inventory, sales, etc., etc. Real time data that many LLMs not necessarily are able to get yet like that. But yes, Google does. So I believe that Google is the player in the best position to be able to provide that experience and they have been already testing that a lot. Also from a predictive search standpoint, I believe that we are going to see, based on our current behavior and historical behavior with Google, hopefully a more sophisticated and more accurate discover-like experience, but for shopping. So yes, Google has all the data and I can see them, they are building little by little that layer of providing that more personalized experience, full customer journey experience into selling and to not necessarily even leave their UI, their pages in order to complete the whole purchase process just until the very end. So, I can see it becoming that eventually. Let\u2019s see if I am right. It\u2019s exciting times, it can go either way, but my bet is it will tend to go that way. Garrett : I feel like you clearly know what you\u2019re talking about and, you know, whether Google kind of, because we hear this conversation in ecommerce of Google and Amazon being the competitors, like what role is Amazon playing? But I think that you\u2019re so right of the experience is becoming more AI-oriented, whether Google gets involved in the transaction layer feels inevitable because that\u2019s an opportunity for them to get more money.

It is going to be so much fun. I can\u2019t wait to talk to you more Aleyda. Thank you so much. I appreciate your time. Aleyda:  No, thank you very much. I\u2019m very looking forward to seeing all of you at SEO week. Garrett : Oh, and last thing, if you haven\u2019t filled out her e-commerce survey, go find it on LinkedIn and make sure you fill out that because the data is fascinating. Aleyda:  It\u2019s going to help us all that. That\u2019s for sure. Garrett:  There you go. All right. See you all. We\u2019ll see you soon. \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t \n \n\t \n\t\t\t \n \n \n\t \n \n\t \t\t \n\t \t\t\t \n\t\t\tRelated Posts\t\t\t

This day focuses on the nuances of enterprise search, vertical-specific strategies like video, local, and e-commerce, and how businesses can build scalable, future-proof search strategies. Just like an ecosystem in nature, SEO relies on various parts that interact with each other. Each part impacts the others. For example, strong content won\u2019t perform well if the technical SEO is broken, and great technical SEO won\u2019t help thin, irrelevant content. Search engines and algorithms are, in a way, living organisms on a constant feedback loop. SEO is an  ecosystem of strategy, content, technology, and user behavior \u2014all working together in a constantly shifting digital environment. To succeed in SEO, you have to think holistically and adaptively, just like in any thriving ecosystem.

The future of SEO is looking a lot more human-centered and intuitive. Search engines are getting smarter\u2014thanks to AI\u2014and they\u2019re learning to understand not just the words we type, but what we  mean . That means old-school tricks like stuffing keywords won\u2019t cut it anymore. Instead, content needs to be genuinely helpful, engaging, and easy to understand. With more people using voice search or asking questions in a more natural, conversational way, businesses will need to adapt by creating content that feels less robotic and more like it\u2019s written for real people.\u00a0 So who\u2019s closing out the week?

This day explores how Al, evolving consumer expectations, and new search experiences are reshaping both how people find information and how brands need to think, create, and adapt their content strategies. We have lots of great stuff on tap from new approaches to content marketing, how new data is informing our insights on search behavior, emotion-based approaches to conversions and more.\u00a0\u00a0 The psychology of search and SEO is undergoing a major transformation due to AI-driven changes in how people find and interact with information. There\u2019s a shift from keywords to conversational and contextual search, in many cases social media and AI assistants are replacing traditional search, AI-generated answers reduce clicks, and search behavior is becoming more multi-modal. Emotional and psychological factors matter more than ever and AI has a growing role in content creation and personalization. What does this mean for SEOs and for brands?

If you haven\u2019t already gotten tickets, we are like we\u2019re under a month \u2013 it is, we are weeks away. April 28 th  to May 1 st , New York City, 40 of the top speakers across SEO, AI, data, content strategy, digital marketing and general business\u2026right you name it. And I\u2019m joined today by someone who is in the weeds of the world of LLM AI content generation and doing a ton of really cool stuff with SEO. I\u2019m joined today by Zack Notes, who is the founder at Sandbox SEO. Thanks for joining me today, Zack. How you doing, man? Zack:  Yeah, thank you, Garrett. It\u2019s great to be here. And I\u2019m excited for SEO Week. I\u2019m working on my slides and I\u2019m happy to be here and chatting with your group. Garrett:  You know, and we were just talking before this there\u2019s so much going on in the world of SEO and AI. The last 12 to 24 months have been wild for practitioners everywhere from like, you know, big enterprise-level brands to startups who are just trying to like get on the map and get in the index and the challenges are real. Things are changing. What\u2019s your perspective on the current state of search? Zack:  Well, there\u2019s really like two sides to it, right? With search, there\u2019s the search users and then there\u2019s also the search marketers. And for the users, like the whole experience of search is changing. And as a result of that, their behaviors are changing and the way they\u2019re thinking about search is shifting and, you know, the capabilities of search and what it can do for them. So, they\u2019re using it in different ways. And then on the other side of it, there\u2019s us who are trying to make sense of it all and make sense of the user behavior that\u2019s changing and the traffic shifts we\u2019re seeing. And, you know, there\u2019s SEOs that are kind of debating a lot over like whether like, you know, SEO for LLM is really that much different than what we\u2019ve been doing, trying to understand our traffic shifts and just like a lot of trying to kind of wrap our head around the changes and how it\u2019s impacting us and the bottom line of our clients and our companies. Garrett:  It\u2019s really hard. Like how are you thinking about data? Because I feel like we\u2019re getting data from Google, from our own websites, from other marketers saying stuff, and it\u2019s so hard to know what we can trust and what is BS. How are you kind of thinking about, you know, in terms like search behavior, like are people using search differently? Is AI overviews generating less traffic? Like where do you stand on that? Zack:  Yeah, sure. So personally, when I\u2019m looking at AI overview traffic, you know, we don\u2019t have like a filter in Google Search Console yet. We\u2019re probably not going to have one for years because it\u2019s probably just not a priority for Google. So, I\u2019m mostly looking at SEMrush to see their AI overview search feature. One thing that\u2019s interesting is like I hear a lot of people talking about how the traffic that\u2019s coming from LLMs, from chatbots like ChatGPT is like so much better converting, and there\u2019s all this attention and interest in like that new traffic. But I question like the causality there. Like if you think of it like a watermelon, right? You take a one-inch cube out of the middle of a watermelon, it\u2019s going to be like the sweetest, juiciest part of the watermelon. And I think those are the LLM users that you\u2019re seeing show up on your site. And like it\u2019s the same customers you had before, it\u2019s just a much smaller segment. And so, you know, I think you kind of have to take it with a grain of salt. And it\u2019s \u2013 and I understand that like it\u2019s just a new behavior. It\u2019s the same people buying the same things or trying to get the same information. They\u2019re just going through a different channel now. Garrett:  I think it\u2019s a great analogy. And it\u2019s very frustrating as marketers, like when we\u2019re in this world of like trying so hard for you know, to find attribution and to say what we\u2019re doing, like causality is like what\u2019s working where we live in a world with marketers that are so focused on correlation and coming to conclusions with potentially incorrect assumptions. I say I\u2019m right with you on that. Speaking of LLMs and kind of like what\u2019s going on in this whole idea of experience gain, can you kind of give a preview? Like I\u2019m excited for your presentation. You\u2019re working on those slides. What are people going to see? What should they get excited about at SEO Week that you\u2019re going to present to us? Zack:  Sure. So I\u2019m going to tell the story of a site I built called Animal Matchup and launched it a few years ago, right when like the OpenAI API came out. And we were kind of like looking for a few different test ideas where we could like test the combination of programmatic SEO with GenAI content. And we saw there was a lot of search volume for like animal versus animal, right? So, like gorilla versus grizzly or like, you know, and it was a really interesting space that at the time, like what I was seeing was a lot of the content that existed was mainly just forum content, opinion pieces, people who have a strong opinion over one animal or the other. And what didn\u2019t exist was any kind of like fight story, sort of creative story about the fight. So, what we did was we used ChatGPT to create actual fight stories. And we have since made 2,000 pages of AI content, a few pages of higher quality handwritten content. But we\u2019ve now been through, you know, eight algorithm updates. And we\u2019ve seen a lot of AI sites get hammered and somehow like we\u2019re still surviving. So, a lot of the talk is about tips that we can give, kind of theories on like why we\u2019re still alive after all these updates. And like tips on scaling AI content. And also, more about like LLM gain, which is basically using LLMs to create features that give users an experience that they\u2019re not already getting on the SERPs and kind of trying to offer something better than the both like the existing competitors, but also then Google and the new AI overviews. Like I think there\u2019s a better experience that could be had if you really take the time to understand the users and the intent and the way that they\u2019re thinking about the search. Garrett:  I love the concept. I love the whole, you know, animal matchup because it\u2019s like, I feel I see these stats of like, you know, some disturbing amount of Americans like think they can actually like destroy a bear. Like you\u2019ve seen that stat of like 6% of Americans think they could fight a bear. So, it makes sense that people are into these creative stories. And there\u2019s so much\u2026I balk at the idea of people who say like, AI generated content is not original or unique or interesting. Like yes, like it\u2019s not at the human capacity, but the prompts and the ideas and the synthesis of creativity, you can do a lot of stuff with that, that you obviously have been working on. I\u2019m very curious to hear about that. And then finally, your point about, you know, just creative uses of this, like the sky\u2019s the limit. So, you mentioned a bunch of tips, like what\u2019s one that someone can consider doing right now for their website in the context of like search and LLMs that they can put into play? Zack:  Sure. So, one tip I have is just sort of a little bit more general outside of just LLM integration, but just internal links, right? We know that we need internal links for indexation and recently did some math that produced a pretty interesting formula. So, I learned that you need at least if you have at least five internal links pointing to random pages within the same template, your orphan page rate goes down below 1%. Garrett:  Ah, interesting. Zack:  And that\u2019s based on like a formula that I was kind of like help, like ChatGPT helped me develop it. I cross checked it across a few different other LLMs, Gemini, Julius, they all arrived at the same formula, E -K . So yeah, it\u2019s just, you know, I\u2019ve seen a lot of people like debate about how many links you need. And then we\u2019ve got like designers and now there\u2019s like a clear formula that we can use that like helps determine that. For LLM generation, one of the tips that I\u2019m going to share, I love GPT in Sheets. I use it to scale content. And one of the challenges with GPT in Sheets is that every time like you refresh the Sheet, it reruns all of your prompts again. So, like A, that costs money and B, you lose like anything that you\u2019ve saved. So, like one simple suggestion is you can use like concat function to save your prompts in the sheets. You don\u2019t have to go searching elsewhere for the prompts. And you also don\u2019t like rerun it again. Garrett:  That is especially for noobs. It\u2019s like if you\u2019re doing this out, like why learn the hard way? Like you\u2019ve done the work and figured out like that, that like kind of little trick. I love that, man. So, what\u2019s next? Like there\u2019s so many directions that the future of search can go for SEO, for LLMs, for user behavior, like short term, long term, Zack, where are you looking? What do you see? Zack:  Yeah, I mean, I think that right now, the average user of LLMs is younger. And I think that like all new technology, like that\u2019s going to scale, or not scale, but shift like older, right? So, I think it\u2019s only going to spread. And so, I think we\u2019re going to have to get like right now, Google is still 90% of search share. And I will see what happens with AI mode. I think that can be pretty pivotal in terms of like shifting LLM-type traffic back to Google. But yeah, I think only more and more people will learn how to use LLMs. And we\u2019re going to have to continuously adjust to that for at least like the next, I\u2019d say five, six years, it\u2019ll probably grow and saturate at that point. Garrett:  It\u2019s so interesting. One thing I learned a lot from the DOJ filings, in terms of the antitrust with Google is just how their whole, you know, kind of argument was based on default search settings, where like Google was the default on Apple and, you know, Firefox and Samsung, all these devices. And you think about like the way they rolled out AI overviews, where, you know, that was people were asking, like, how do I turn it off, but it was like a forced experience. You almost wonder with AI mode, if Google is going to take the risk that they did with AI overviews and making it a forced experience at some point, or how will people ultimately be, you know, forced to use these types of tools so that the technology kind of forces user change? Like, do you think Google has so big a moat that regardless, they\u2019ll kind of come out on top or do you think other new emerging competitors like OpenAI will actually chip away at the AI dominance? Zack:  Yeah, I think Google\u2019s pretty good at UX and they kind of take it slow. And I think that there will be a lot of like little mini entry points where they nudge us over to the AI mode tab and try to kind of introduce us to it and get people used to it. I don\u2019t think that they\u2019re just, I mean, it\u2019s really keyword dependent, right? Like which keywords you\u2019re on. But yeah, I think there will be a period where they\u2019re kind of having to teach and onboard people about the existence of AI mode. But given the popularity of ChatGPT, I think that we\u2019re close to a point where most people will know about it and use it. And I think it will probably eat away at OpenAI\u2019s share to a big extent, just because of, like you said, like the default search engine for people, like it\u2019s path of least resistance. You\u2019re already going there. It\u2019s got a muscle memory. Yeah. Garrett:  Have there been any like non-tech, non-SEO folks in your life that you\u2019ve seen them like use ChatGPT or any of these tools for the first time and seen what their experience is like? I mean, I find really interesting right now. Like I introduced it to like, you know, my 70-year-old dad at one point or people who don\u2019t have that sort of like latent experience with AI and it almost seems magical to them. What have you been seeing in interactions of people trying this out and do they get the utility? Are there minds blown or are they like not interested? Zack:  It\u2019s kind of funny. So, my dad introduced me to the internet when I was like 12 years old. He called me into his office and said, \u201cHey, I want to show you something.\u201d And he showed me the website of like the Autobahn. And I was like, I couldn\u2019t care less. That\u2019s cool, dad. I don\u2019t care. And so, and since then, like he\u2019s been sort of like for me, like an inspiration for someone that he builds neural networks and he still codes even though he\u2019s like 82. Like he was a math major, like very much kind of an early adopter. My dad gives zero F\u2019s about ChatGPT. My mom is the power user. She uses it for like shopping comparisons, making decisions, gardening questions, cooking questions. And he still like doesn\u2019t realize how big of a deal it is, which is really like amazing to me. Garrett:  And that is so fascinating. Zack, I cannot wait to have more conversations with you in New York. Thank you so much for taking the time and, you know, kind of giving me your perspective. I can\u2019t wait to see your deck. I don\u2019t know if any help getting that that slides. It sounds like you are very close to being ready to just crush it on the stage. So, thank you so much, man. Zack:  Yeah, it\u2019s good meeting you again. Garrett:  Good meeting you too. So, you guys, if you haven\u2019t got your tickets yet, April 28 th  to May 1 st , New York City, you got to be there. It\u2019s going to be The Next Chapter in Search and learn so much. Hopefully we will see you there. And thanks for watching.

If you haven\u2019t got your tickets, New York City, April 28th to May 1st, we\u2019re going to have speakers across the entire week, across SEO, data, AI, content, digital marketing, you name it. This is the event. Like, this is the first one, and it\u2019s going to be so amazing. We\u2019ve got 40 of the most fantastic speakers who are going to blow your mind on The Next Chapter of Search. And I am joined by one of them today. I am so hyped. None other than Jori Ford. She\u2019s the Chief Marketing and Product Officer at Food Boss, and she is going to talk all about hybrid engine optimization. What\u2019s up, Jori? How you doing? Jori:  I\u2019m doing great, Garrett. Thank you for hyping me up so much. Now I\u2019m all smiling and blushing. Garrett : Nah, nah, nah. \u2018Cause it is, we are so excited about this event. You and I were geeking out, like, before we even started this recording. I want to dive in, because I can\u2019t wait for your presentation, but before you give us, like, a little taste, a little preview \u2013 current state of SEO, last 12 to 24 months have been wild. From your perspective, what does it look like? Jori:  I mean, everybody knows AI is, like, the hot topic, right? And I think in this era of, like, AI-driven search, there\u2019s been a lot of major transformation. I agree with you. Particularly, though, for me, I look at it as the new crawling behaviors, right? And all the new statistics that are related to it. I think if you really think about it, it\u2019s a new phase where we have to do a blended approach as Search Engine Optimization specialists, but also as marketers. You\u2019ll hear a lot of people saying brand is key, and I think that that\u2019s the truth of the matter now, because AI taking over is absorbing data from so many different places, right? That people are like, \u201cwhere is my traffic going to come from?\u201d And now even Search is segmented by AI, right? Google\u2019s like, \u201chey, we\u2019re going to use AI, too.\u201d And it\u2019s not getting smaller. It\u2019s getting more and more ginormous, right? You go to Google and you put in any kind of search today, even if you\u2019re asking something about, like, SaaS, right? It used to be, \u201cwe\u2019re going to recommend some brands to you.\u201d Now they\u2019re going to recommend code, brands, frameworks that are going to build the thing for you, and it\u2019s going to take up way more real estate than it used to. So now you have to figure out how do you make sure that you\u2019re part of AI, you\u2019re part of the overviews, you\u2019re still part of search, and your brand stands out, because it\u2019s capitalizing on 20 different resources when it\u2019s displaying this stuff. AI agents are displaying all of those resources, too, right? Every source is now cited. So, what you really want to think about now is, how do you become one of those cited sources instead of how do you rank number one? I think that\u2019s the current state we\u2019re in, is, how do you become the source of the content? And I think content marketing used to be, like, the big namesake, right? But now content marketing is being infiltrated by AI. So now it\u2019s like, how do you actually become a relevant resource of content to be researched and developed using AI in search? That\u2019s where I really think the landscape is. Garrett : The whole thing is so fascinating, because I remember months ago we were talking about, do you, if you even could, block crawlers from the LLMs because there\u2019s the IP issue of it, but you have all these different channels. You have to worry about Google\u2019s index, Bing\u2019s index. You don\u2019t even know if maybe OpenAI is building their own index, because they have their own. So, give me the preview, kind of this leads right into what you\u2019re talking about, SEO Week. What do we got to know? What are we going to learn when you\u2019re talking? Jori:  Okay, well, I think one of the biggest things you got to think about is it\u2019s a hybrid environment, so how do you hybridize your approach? Everybody who knows me knows I\u2019m big on crawlers. The reason I\u2019m big on crawlers, and I usually say everything starts with a crawler, is log files are the only way you actually know what\u2019s happening on your site, right? Even if a bot\u2019s not listening to you, right? Because like you said, you know, ChatGPT and its new AI agent, you don\u2019t know if it\u2019s ignoring your robots.txt, but you do if you look at your log files. All of them come through in the log files. So, for me, looking at that hybrid environment, it\u2019s about how do we continue to look at how Google crawls and indexes based off of links, all the things we know, structure, freshness, while also figuring out how to prioritize high quality structured content for AI agents. And the issue is, is that brands are going to look at it and go, \u201cI want to be trending, I want to be on top of these things, and I\u2019m going to take the seat that I\u2019ve always taken as a marketer,\u201d and you do what\u2019s best for your brand at the time that\u2019s relevant to you with the resources you have. You don\u2019t just jump into the AI game and go, \u201cyou know what, we\u2019re going to restructure our whole website. We were doing JSON-LD and showing up really well in Google search engine, but we got 10% of our traffic from AI agents. We need to change everything to be flattened and have structured data everywhere, because we know, right, it can\u2019t be parsed by JavaScript, so it\u2019s actually got to be embedded in the page.\u201d How do you start understanding how to manipulate for embeddings? Big, big changes, right? So, for me, I\u2019m looking at it and thinking, how do I help you understand how to take a hybrid approach to understanding how the crawlers, from both an AI perspective and a search perspective are crawling, and leverage that frequency plus how they\u2019re hitting your channels to determine which strategies to plan for next? Instead of that being  the  strategy, it\u2019s indicative of the strategies you should take. Garrett : It\u2019s so fascinating, because you\u2019re right. There\u2019s a lot of really important business decisions where you\u2019re trying your best to future-proof with the resources you have, with so much uncertainty about how user behavior will actually change and whether it\u2019s worth it to do this now or wait. So, based on all that, what\u2019s one thing you are recommending to people that they tactically should do right now in the context of your presentation? Jori:  Okay, I will say something that I think, I\u2019m going to say it again later in my presentation, but I\u2019ll give it away. If we know that content is really important, we know that structured data is really important, we know that it\u2019s going to show up in answer engines, and we still want to show up classically in Google, I think creating AI-citable answer blocks within your high-authority pages are the way to tackle that, right? Because you\u2019re giving the LLMs and the ChatGPTs, the Perplexities, Claude, they like that quoted, structured, concise, self-contained, blocked information. Put it high up there, right? But we also know Google loves it, right? Remember the age of FAQs being at the top as the bulleted list. Everybody was like, \u201cThat\u2019s the dumbest thing, let\u2019s get rid of it. Why would we concentrate everything we know about an entire topic at the top as bullet points?\u201d And now it\u2019s back. I think that that\u2019s going to be the biggest highlight because those blocks are going to get scraped, they\u2019re going to get embedded, they\u2019re going to get cited, they\u2019re going to be more reliable, they\u2019re going to be concise, and you can fit your brand in there, right? So, I think that\u2019s going to help you win with the featured snippets, it\u2019s going to help you win with the people also ask, it\u2019s going to get you highly cited within the AI overviews, and it\u2019s going to be in the AI agent. Garrett : It\u2019s so good because it\u2019s like, we always talk these days about quality content, EAT, all that stuff, but you also have to remember that Google, it\u2019s machines, it\u2019s efficiency, there\u2019s money, you\u2019re crawling, takes resources on their end, so, structured data makes it easier to extract. There\u2019s so many reasons that that\u2019s the way to go. So big picture, you\u2019re mitigating strategies, what\u2019s next for search? What do you think is coming next in the way that people search and Google and AI and all that? Jori:  Well, I actually think that like, Google\u2019s kind of leaning into the thought that it\u2019s going to be a hybrid engine, right? Everybody keeps saying things and I\u2019m going to be in trouble with many of my friends who are going to be speaking at SEO Week because SEO is  not  dead, AI is  not  taking over, because the engine that everybody\u2019s used to collectively is hybridizing. So, Google\u2019s still going to maintain a huge share, right? A lot of these LLMs, LLMs, I love saying that \u2019cause it always messes me up, they\u2019re leaning on Google\u2019s index and there\u2019s a big difference, right? It\u2019s indexed information. I said, we need to become the cited source. So, for me, I feel like search is going to evolve into a hybridized state, that\u2019s why I felt like my topic was really important, especially as a launching pad for what other people are going to talk about, because as we know it, it\u2019ll no longer be, how do we get crawled? How does this happen? But we\u2019re going to have to think of a constructive way to optimize for all things because we no longer get to lean on, \u201cI\u2019m going to need to show up just here or there,\u201d here and there are now the same, right? Eventually AI agents and Google are going to be used synonymously because Gemini is pretty much spewing out search results plus AI answers. They\u2019re the same thing now, right? And so, I think it\u2019s just going to continue to happen until we hit the point of diminishing returns with these AI agents. And it\u2019s going to be, does the big eat the little? Which I don\u2019t know if you\u2019ve been around for a while, but every single time a little comes up, the big guy eats it. And I don\u2019t think Google\u2019s trying to take a back seat and Bing\u2019s trying to step up as well. So, when you got two big guys, I think they\u2019re going to eat the little guys again, honestly. So, I think that\u2019s where we\u2019re going to end up is hybridized state in the same engines that we were used to, they\u2019re just going to evolve instead. Garrett : I can\u2019t wait to your presentation, such good stuff. And I\u2019m with you because it\u2019s like, you\u2019re already seeing it both like the general AI output of this conversational search, but you\u2019re also seeing the AI-curated results, which is probably what people want. They don\u2019t just want the conversations, they still want things organized. Jori, okay, I can\u2019t wait to just spend time and talk to you at SEO Week. Jori:  I\u2019m excited. Garrett : It\u2019s going to be awesome. So, you guys, if you haven\u2019t gotten your tickets yet, end of April, the 28th, to May 1st, New York City, we\u2019ll see you there.

I\u2019m joined today by Michael Carini, who is the founder and CEO at Lastmile. Thank you so much for joining me today, Michael. How are you doing, man? Michael:  I\u2019m doing great. Thanks for having me. Garrett:  I\u2019m excited for this conversation because I come from a background in local SEO, and that\u2019s what you guys do, and the local space and the local SEO is changing so dramatically right now. The last 12 to 24 months have been wild, and it\u2019s rapid. Every day, something new. What is your perspective on the current state of SEO? Michael:  Here\u2019s what I think is a really interesting thing, and we actually celebrated 10 years last month. I know, it went fast. But what we\u2019ve seen now really for the first time is a shift along two axes. Google over the 10 years I\u2019ve been doing this has often experimented with different kind of mediums and presentation for localized search results. But now what we\u2019re also seeing is not only this new medium with generative search results and AIO and all that stuff, but we\u2019re actually now seeing a channel shift as well. Now we\u2019re seeing customers start to branch out beyond Google, and I think what\u2019s going to be significant ways, although the metrics aren\u2019t great yet and it\u2019s kind of hard to measure, but you actually have people doing local searches on channels like Perplexity and ChatGPT and other emerging platforms. I think you\u2019re starting to see a balkanization of search that we haven\u2019t really experienced for a long time. Garrett:  It\u2019s so interesting. I\u2019ve already enjoyed really playing with it, because to your point, I was on ChatGPT the other day and I was testing out AI mode and ChatGPT and I was asking both platforms, testing local, to what extent are they getting it right? Because they\u2019re still figuring it out too. And I was like, okay, based on being 10 minutes away from a pizza place, what\u2019s the best pizza place based on the reviews that you can pull and seeing how it\u2019s pulling in that content, are you like kind of like, what are you seeing on your end? Michael:  We\u2019re seeing a pretty big, I think, content gap right now. So, if you think about what Google has been doing over the last 10, 20 years, is they\u2019ve been building kind of proprietary ways to get rich local information into their ecosystem. And so that\u2019s everything from merchant center where you can send them in-store inventory to hotel kind of meta search where you can send them specific rates in real time. And so there\u2019s a lot of kind of infrastructure that Google has specifically created around sucking in great local content and then being able to present that to customers as a competitive advantage. So, I think if you start looking at Perplexity and ChatGPT and those other channels, they are going to have kind of a pretty steep hill to climb to catch up there. But today, really the problem is they only can access what they can crawl right from your brand\u2019s website. And that\u2019s where I think right now there\u2019s kind of a gap because if you look at the local pages that a lot of brands put out there, speaking frankly, they\u2019re very thin content, very limited content. And ChatGPT and other crawlers really can\u2019t kind of access things like e-commerce APIs or hotel APIs that do have that rich local content. But that\u2019s kind of a walled garden. So, I think where we\u2019re going to very quickly see things evolve is connections into these other gen AI systems to try to get them better content quickly. Garrett:  I love it. And it\u2019s so important and interesting because to your point with ChatGPT, it\u2019s like they don\u2019t have to deal with Google when they\u2019re looking for information. They\u2019re actually going to Bing\u2019s index for the most part, or maybe building their own index we think. So, it\u2019s like you can\u2019t just depend on a Google business profile for your whole local presence. How, generally speaking, is like Lastmile adapting to search? Michael:  Yeah. One of the big things that we are laser focused on this year is information architecture. So, when we look at a lot of, because we\u2019re unique in that we really only operate for large enterprise organizations. Those are our client base. And so, what we\u2019ve been doing is spending a ton of time on refining like what is the best way to structure your local information on your website to optimize not only for Google crawling, but also for these other generative platforms. And so, what we often find is in these big enterprises, information architecture has always been something that just kind of happened by circumstance. And you have in many cases, local information spread out across, in some cases, dozens of sub-directories on these large sites. And it makes it really, I think, confusing and hard to understand really what all the offerings are, both for customers and for crawlers. And so, we\u2019ve been really focused on building kind of best practices around how to restructure your information. And we\u2019re already kind of seeing really nice gains from some of those optimizations. Garrett:  It\u2019s so interesting to me because I feel like in local and in SEO in general, we\u2019ve heard this like drumbeat over and over now about brand and how brand continues to be important. But like enterprises have that kind of built in advantage, but it\u2019s like, it\u2019s not enough. You also need the content. So, you show up for those more specific granular types of searches, conversational search on like ChatGPT. Michael:  And that\u2019s the other side of the coin is how do I make, put more local content out there in a way that\u2019s accurate. If I put all the same set of products on all of my local pages, that\u2019s not really reflecting reality in many cases. So, what we\u2019ve also been doing is building a lot of tooling around, how do we access both programmatic sources of data, things like those inventory databases, stuff that\u2019s locked away in the point of sale or whatever it might be. And then actually get that out there onto, we don\u2019t just make local pages, we make full kind of microsites, but you don\u2019t want to put 50,000 products on a microsite. So, you actually need kind of a rules engine and tooling around how do I know what specific product services offerings to put in front of the customers and the crawlers. And so that\u2019s been a really interesting kind of intellectual challenge, but the tooling we\u2019ve built has gotten pretty good at that. And so, I think that\u2019s starting to give the brands we work with a really nice advantage as these platforms emerge to say, \u201cHey, we have really fine-tuned control over what we surface to the customer.\u201d Garrett:  It\u2019s so interesting and it\u2019s so important to me because you\u2019re not completely at the behest of the Google ecosystem as these other platforms emerge and as people\u2019s behaviors do shift and people actually go to the LLMs platforms for local commerce and local retail. So, what\u2019s next? I mean, we\u2019ve got all this talk about agentic AI and people using their own agents to go to it. We got local evolving and AI curated results. What do you think is next for the future of search? Michael:  Yeah, I think we are really at the very ground floor here in terms of what we\u2019re going to see in terms of these platforms\u2019 capabilities. I had a good chat with Greg Sterling a few weeks ago. We were talking about just how immature the commerce part of GPT is right now. Like if you do certain, even in Perplexity, if you do certain local searches, \u201cHey, what store has this thing near me?\u201d How often you\u2019re getting like, \u201cWell, we kind of know\u2026\u201d We do all cell phone stuff, right? We know T-Mobile sells iPhones, so we think maybe they have it. I\u2019m paraphrasing, but that\u2019s kind of the level of information depth and quality you\u2019re getting today. And so, I think you can only really go up from where we are now. And so, I think you\u2019re going to see as a lot of these platforms start trying to kind of shift from heavy investment to monetization, right? They\u2019re going to start paying a lot of attention to the customer experience around commerce and around buying and really refine those interfaces. And the brands that can kind of best power that information are the ones that are going to win. Garrett:  I love that. It\u2019s really interesting because I feel like as this behavior, the search behavior kind of becomes more common, the expectations are going to be raised. Like right now we don\u2019t expect them to get it right. Like you\u2019re almost used to this consumer experience of like going to the store and them not having it. You just be like, \u201cDamn it, I knew that was going to happen and yet here we are.\u201d But it\u2019s like you\u2019re setting brands up for not having that disappointment experience for their consumers. Michael:  Right. And then the other thing here is on the brand side, we\u2019re trying to set expectations with our clients and prospects, which is everyone\u2019s been used to seeing incremental growth in search every year, right? Especially as their brands grow. I think that period might be over or at least suspended right now. But the problem that we\u2019re facing is there really isn\u2019t good source metrics on this yet, right? So, we see already AIO is definitely cannibalizing organic traffic, right, for our clients. But it\u2019s not like Google\u2019s putting good information on AIO in search console yet. So, we\u2019re kind of trying to say, \u201cHey everyone, let\u2019s take a breather. The sky is not falling down, but search is for sure changing.\u201d And I think that\u2019s another kind of looking towards the future area that\u2019s going to be really, really important is how do we start measuring brand visibility across these new mediums and channels? Garrett:  It\u2019s great because it is so frustrating for like, as we\u2019ve made sort of this kind of paradigm shift to performance marketing, there\u2019s this expectation to be able to monitor and attribute everything and that\u2019s just not the case with this. And then finally, Michael, you guys are hosting the Monday night opening party soiree. Are you going to be there? Are you going to talk to everyone? Michael:  I\u2019m so excited.

And we are just really grateful to be a partner here. Garrett:  Well, thank you so much. I\u2019m excited.

If you haven\u2019t already gotten your tickets, we\u2019re going to be in New York City the end of April, the 28th to May 1st, four days of just nonstop SEO data, AI content, LLMs, you name it. And we\u2019ve got experts across all the industries that are going to be cranking out really action-packed insights. And I am so excited to be joined by a really awesome dude who\u2019s put together a kind of game changing piece of software. I\u2019m joined today by James Cadwallader, who is the co-founder at Profound \u2013 Profound helps you monitor your brand visibility across Co-pilot, Gemini, AI overviews, and of course, ChatGPT and Perplexity. Thanks for joining me today, James. How you doing, man? James : Hey, Garrett. Nice to be here. Garrett : I, this is so your wheelhouse because you\u2019ve been eating and breathing this market of brands who want to pay attention to their visibility on these platforms, as well as Google as a search engine and AI overviews. Can you share what\u2019s your perspective on the current state of search? James:  I mean, from our perspective, yeah, so I\u2019m James, yeah. Co-founder, CEO here at Profound. We\u2019re a New York City-based startup. And yeah, our view of the world is that this is one of the biggest platform shifts in the history of marketing, period. I think today, AI visibility, AI optimization, answer engine optimization, the non-clich\u00e9 is not sticking, but this, this new thing, it kind of sits on the shoulders of the world of traditional search and SEO. But what we\u2019re expecting looking forward is that it\u2019s, we\u2019re going to see a ton of change. And a lot less, you know, over the years and, you know, traditional search, you\u2019ve seen like lots of incremental, lots of change, but in quite incremental fashion. But in this new world, we\u2019re expecting these giant leaps, you know, agentic browsing, you know, we have like, already we\u2019re starting to see things like a perplexity launching Comment, their own browser, we\u2019re seeing Operator from OpenAI. We\u2019re expecting the answer engines to, you know, start really implementing their own indexes, in a meaningful way. New, you know, new introductions of things like voice, I think will have a huge difference, personalization and memory. That there\u2019s, I think people are underestimating. I think today this is, you know, the world of answer engine optimization and SEO kind of sit hand in hand, or one on top of it, you know, the, the last are being built on top of the former, but I think we\u2019re expecting a huge fork there. And what I, I personally believe that every brand on the planet will have an AI Visibility Department. Garrett : Which is a perfect segue into your talk, because you\u2019re talking all about like the agent experience optimization and, and what brands should be doing right now. Can you give a preview about what you\u2019ll be talking about and why, why it\u2019s like going to matter to marketers and SEOs? James:  Sure. So I think the, you know, again, to sort of go wide aperture or a bit more abstract to start off with it, in the old world, if it were, you had the brand and the consumer and yeah, there were Google sat in between that relationship and Google would introduce the consumer to your brand, you know, via some sort of a top of funnel search. And then you as a brand were pushing that consumer down the funnel into conversion, essentially. Obviously, that\u2019s a simplified take, but nonetheless, there were essentially two parties with Google playing a connector. In this new world, there\u2019s three parties and we have the brand, the consumer, but sitting in between those two parties really is ChatGPT or the answer engine for all intents and purposes. And the answer engine is controlling that relationship with the consumer, more similar almost to what we\u2019ve seen in influencer marketing, for example. So, your job now as a brand is to feed the answer engine with all the information that it needs to, so when it\u2019s having conversations with that end consumer about your industry, your business, your competitors, that it can thoughtfully respond on your behalf, essentially. So that kind of introduces this topic of AX, which is, yeah, essentially, you know, we\u2019re all very familiar with the idea of user experience. How does a user come in and navigate your content, your website? And in this new world, it really comes down to how do agents interact with your content? And we\u2019re seeing some very interesting new developments or some very interesting new paradigms where, you know, ChatGPT isn\u2019t caching right now, as an example. So, our platform, Profound, we\u2019ve built arguably the category leader in AI visibility software right now. We\u2019re used by a large chunk of Fortune 500 brands, enterprise brands, mid-market brands are relying on Profound for their AI visibility. And we have CDN level integrations, so we\u2019re seeing how retrieval crawlers are visiting websites. So OpenAI\u2019s crawlers are coming to websites in real time to gather information when answering questions about that brand or even open-ended questions about that industry. Garrett : And it\u2019s so important because, you know, there\u2019s a lot of conversations between like publishers and brands of like making their content available or like cutting off their nose despite their face. What is like one specific takeaway or one specific recommendation that you can make right now for brands that want to make sure that they are visible as these crawlers are, you know, gobbling up every information, every piece of content they can? James:  I\u2019m going to give you two. First is going to just sound extremely self-serving, but I really mean it. You know, it\u2019s my most honest answer is you need to track what\u2019s going on. If you aren\u2019t paying attention to your AI visibility, like\u2026most brands who we speak to when we first speak to them still have no idea what their AI visibility is. You know, if I search for running sneaker, does your brand show up in the response? Yes or no? Or if so, like what\u2019s the, you know, these models are probabilistic. So what\u2019s the percentage? If I ask it a thousand times, how many do you show? How many, what percentage of answers does your brand appear in? And then, you know, that\u2019s the most rudimentary. Beyond that, you\u2019re looking at, okay, well, which citation, you know, why, which citations are being used that are making your, ensuring your brand shows up. Or even more granular, we can say when you show up and your brand, you know, your dot com is being used as a source or a citation, which pages specifically from your.com are getting pulled into answer engines? And if you publish new pages, are they getting pulled into these answer engine responses? And we can start to, you know, our software profound allows you to understand that. So yeah, I think the first step is just to know what\u2019s going on. I think being blind right now is probably the biggest, is the biggest sin here, just like paying no attention to what\u2019s going on is the biggest sin. But maybe more in the spirit of your question, Garrett, so, you know, asking for more pragmatic tips, you\u2019re on just tracking and understanding what\u2019s going on. We\u2019re seeing that brands dot coms are like your on-page dot com content is being very effective and can be utilized in a very powerful way in answer engine responses. So yeah, a big group of our customers are doing something very \u2013 we\u2019re about to release a case study with one of our big customers in the coming weeks, and they published a bunch of dot com content that was optimized for retrieval agents. And how was it optimized? You know, the content was more self-serving. It was better schema\u2019d. It was that we ensured that the URL slugs were perfectly worked out for retrieval engines to pull in. I mean, that\u2019s just a tip of the iceberg, but by creating that content, they increase their share of citations, so they were becoming more cited as a source of information. And because the content was perfectly structured, they increased their visibility as well. And we\u2019ve seen that visibility in AI answers go up, the answer engine saying their name more in the responses, which is pretty cool. Garrett : Oh my goodness, there\u2019s so much to unpack there. And that\u2019s why people have to come and hear your presentation, because it\u2019s like you said, you know, you have to change your perspective on the probabilistic results and how it becomes that much harder in a lot of ways for SEOs. Like we\u2019re so used to, I mean, you go from advertising, which is like precision performance marketing, and then we\u2019re talking more general accuracy. And then thinking about the technicalities, there\u2019s a lot of debate and misinformation out there in terms of what the crawlers are picking up in terms of JavaScript and structured data. And I think there\u2019s a lot of clarification that your team is putting out and seeing people on the ground trying and experimenting and figuring out what\u2019s working. It\u2019s so interesting. Now, going forward, you kind of touched on it, but like The Next Chapter of Search, which is the theme of the conference, do you believe that Google has a moat? Or are you really bullish on all these other competitors ultimately stealing market share and changing the way that people search for things? James:  I think 2024 was kind of, it was the year of the foundation model. And while everyone was battling over the incremental benefits of these different foundational LLMs, what actually happened in secret, or I should say, right in front of, under our noses was ChatGPT became the de facto consumer product. My mum uses ChatGPT, which is obviously very anecdotal, but they\u2019re really starting to make headway in the consumer race. Who has captured the consumer\u2019s attention? Because the consumer doesn\u2019t really care about token windows and the number of parameters used in the model. The consumer just wants a good product and it\u2019s become like a product game. And ChatGPT is now used by 5% of the world\u2019s population on a weekly basis. Sundar, CEO of Google, has mandated 500 million weekly actives by the end of this year. So there\u2019s this huge consumer race that\u2019s taking place right now. And yeah, I think our prediction is that it will be more fragmented than traditional search. Whether that will change over time, we\u2019ll see more consolidation maybe to a monopolistic environment by what we\u2019ve seen in traditional search with Google, who knows. But no, I think this is OpenAI or this is ChatGPT\u2019s game to lose. And then there\u2019s kind of outliers as well. Grok from XAI is very interesting. They have an unfair advantage with the data funnel because of the tweets that they can use. Obviously, there\u2019s things like DeepSeek or even Copilot. I wouldn\u2019t write Microsoft Copilot off here. There\u2019s lots of movement going on. I think what we are expecting this year, and we\u2019ve seen it with Perplexity, early glimpses of it with Perplexity, with Perplexity Pro Shopping, but we\u2019re expecting shopability to fold into ChatGPT at some point. There\u2019s a huge iceberg of unattributed traffic right now. Even myself, I\u2019m a power user of these answer engines. If I research a brand or a product on ChatGPT, nine times out of ten, I\u2019ll head back over to Google to complete the purchase or Amazon to complete over there without actually clicking anything. So there\u2019s no way to attribute \u2013 or it\u2019s very difficult to attribute that. We\u2019re starting to build those attribution bridges as well, which is very interesting. So, we\u2019re seeing some of our customers are getting thousands of attributed web visits that we can attribute back to answer engines through network log fingerprinting, which is pretty cool. Garrett : It\u2019s such a fun thing to talk about because nobody really does know. But to your point, it\u2019s like there are so many players you mentioned like Amazon. At what point do they get involved in the game? Facebook and Meta. And obviously, you mentioned Perplexity, and there\u2019s a big piece of the pie from a monetization the transactional commercial aspect of things kind of folding in. Dude, I can\u2019t wait to talk to you more at this conference. You\u2019re going to get a chance to talk to all the other folks here. So, if you want a chance to come and talk to James, find out more about Profound, what opportunities it has for your brand, and obviously see all of our great speakers at SEO Week, I hope you come to New York City at the end of April.

IR industry\u2019s outdated view of modern SEO \u2013 Are we all just spammers? What does SEO contribute to modern search \u2013 the bridge SEO represents takes us from villains to heroes. IR research rebuking SEO, which arguably doesn\u2019t understand SEO basics. Whilst IR researchers focus on Gen AI, the web burns and SEOs help to put out the fires. \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t \n\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t Transcript \t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t \n\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t Garrett : Okay, here we go. Welcome to The Next Chapter of Search produced by SEO Week and iPullRank. Today I\u2019m joined by Dawn Anderson. Dawn is the Principal Consultant and Managing Director at Bertey. She is going to tell us all about information retrieval. Thanks for joining me today, Dawn. Dawn : Thank you for asking me, Garrett, and I\u2019m really pleased to be here. And I just realized that we have matching tops on. We have matching colors. Garrett : Oh, well, you got the email where I said you have to wear purple for the interview, and you came wearing purple. It\u2019s very royal, very royal. Dawn:  Yeah, yeah, yeah. Garrett : So, I\u2019d love to know kind of where your perspective, where are we currently in the state of SEO, especially in the context of information retrieval? Dawn:  Right, well, as I say, I think we always have to prefix any conversation about information retrieval by saying, \u201cactually web search literally is information retrieval. It\u2019s an aspect of information retrieval.\u201d So, Google and all search engines are part of information retrieval because there is sometimes that detachment that people think that they are separate things, but literally search is the same thing. I think we\u2019re in a stage now where ultimately the whole machine, if you like, the whole IR pipeline, the whole web search pipeline is being rebuilt from the ground up. Especially the multimodal aspect of it \u2013 historically, I think we\u2019re increasingly moving away from the 10 blue links scenario, much more multimodal, much more intent-driven. So, I mean, ultimately we are in this scenario now where Gen AI is definitely coming through. There are some challenges. We know that there\u2019s been all these quality issues over the past year or so as they\u2019re trying to push these things through. But increasingly, I believe that we\u2019ll get grounding. We will get more grounding, particularly as we don\u2019t let up on structured data, we keep going with schema and so forth. Search engines are literally going to just keep learning from all the data and so forth. And RAG and then Graph RAG as well is going to come through to reinforce further. So yeah, so I think that we\u2019ll have a very rounded search experience. We\u2019re going to definitely have AI agents coming through. So that\u2019ll be another experience as well. It\u2019ll just be increasingly holistic for the searcher. Garrett : So, there\u2019s so many moving parts that are happening right now. For your presentation at SEO Week, what do you think, what is the topic that\u2019s really going to be valuable for all the attendees there? Dawn:  I think, well, I\u2019m hoping to illustrate the changes that are happening, not just in SEO. Because I think we kind of think that it\u2019s just happening to us and nothing else is happening around. But the changes that are happening in the IR industry and web search industry overall are just humongous. So, I wanted to kind of illustrate those changes that are going on in the background that we don\u2019t know about. The struggles that search engines are going through, if you like, the developments there, particularly with regards to some of the iterative changes in how maybe quality rating is done and how algorithmic pushouts are done and so forth. Because that will impact us. We had an ever flux of core updates this past few months. Every time we have those, there is some impact somewhere. So, I\u2019m going to be covering some of that, looking at how that\u2019s, why that\u2019s happening, and what we can do to address that. And just look at the changing SERPs, if you like. Garrett : Yeah, it\u2019s so important. I feel like your talk will change people\u2019s perspectives in terms of that volatility that you\u2019ve really been focusing on. Based on whether it\u2019s changing algorithm updates or just the daily dynamic nature of SERPs, what are some of the practical takeaways? Like what should people do right now for SEO, taking all that into consideration? Dawn:  I think that they definitely need to work on more of a breadth and precision aligned. So, precision to query intent is really key, really key. I think that we need to definitely take a broad approach as well. Make sure that we have comprehensiveness of the topic aligned with our audience. And yeah, I think we just need to take a very rounded view, appreciating that query intent shift is constantly happening. Dynamic re-ranking is happening. We shouldn\u2019t expect us to see the same results for a keyword constantly. And I think there is an obsession, particularly when you\u2019re dealing with some clients, if you drop down a couple of places, that they almost feel that they have ownership of certain keywords, and that\u2019s not the case anymore because intent is constantly, constantly shifting. So, I think precision, good content strands, comprehensiveness of topic, understanding your audience really, really well, and alignment is going to be the big takeaway, really. Garrett : Oh, that\u2019s so good. Because I mean, to your point, and this seems to be the theme of what you\u2019re thinking, is nothing is static anymore. SEO, not that it\u2019s ever been a set it and let it, but you really can\u2019t just rest on your laurels, say \u201cI did work, and that I can now just let that compound and do its own thing.\u201d What do you think is this future of SEO? What\u2019s next for web search, from your perspective? Dawn:  I don\u2019t think it\u2019s going away anytime soon, but it\u2019s going to be different. It\u2019s going to be completely different. I think, I mean, well, for instance, it was pretty funny the other day\u2026somebody on Facebook had pulled together, somebody had asked a question of DeepSeek, actually. I mean, I know that this is not web search, but I think eventually there\u2019ll be almost like a blurring of lines between these AI agents, and there\u2019ll be the chatbots, and obviously, I think there will be definitely a blurring of offerings, if you like, with people seeking information in many, many ways all of the time. But somebody had actually asked a question of DeepSeek and said, \u201cBuild me a team of the best 25 SEOs in the world.\u201d And I mean, it was nice. I was on the list, which was quite flattering, really. I thought, \u201cwhere the heck did that come from?\u201d Because obviously I\u2019ve been very quiet for the past few years. I\u2019ve not been on any of the roundup lists, and I\u2019ve not been on any of the hundred little SEOs that you should follow and so forth. So, I think these machines are just going to surface information from the deepest depths and just bring it up from nowhere. So, because I was surprised to find myself on that list, I was like, \u201cOh.\u201d But the point is, I just think that information will just be bubbled up from all over the place, everywhere, everywhere. Garrett : That\u2019s so interesting. And last question, I guess, do you think Google will maintain its market dominance going forward, or what likelihood do you think that we\u2019ll see actual search engine competitors, or just if search behavior changes, other competitors like the DeepSeeks and the Chats GPT in the world? Dawn : Yeah, I think that they\u2019ve certainly got their work cut out. I think that they need to up their game. I mean, we\u2019re presuming that they\u2019re going to stand still, and they\u2019re not, of course, and they\u2019re going to improve. And they\u2019ve moved their search guy into innovation, and he\u2019s a brilliant engineer, regardless of what anybody thinks from a search and commercial perspective. So, they have got brilliant engineers. I think it\u2019s going to be a battle. It\u2019s going to be a battle. I don\u2019t know whether they\u2019ll dominate anything like this as much as they have, but I think that maybe the opportunity will grow, maybe because people will just be searching everywhere, different surfaces. So, I think they\u2019re going to have their work cut out, let\u2019s put it that way. Garrett : There you go. So really fascinating stuff.

I\u2019m so excited. We are literally under two weeks. Everything\u2019s locked in. I mean, I hope by the time you\u2019re watching this, we don\u2019t, we still have tickets for you to buy because we might not. It\u2019s, this event is packed, and it is April 28th to May 1st, New York City. And I have been talking to all these amazing speakers and literally this is the last one to finish it off. I am joined by none other than Lexi Mills. Lexi is brilliant. She is the CEO at Shift6 and we are going to talk all about the future of digital PR and AI. Lexi, thanks for joining me today. How are you doing? Lexi:  Oh, thanks so much for having me. It\u2019s a pleasure to be here. I\u2019m super excited about this conference. I think we\u2019ve really, really needed a high-level conference that says, \u201cWhat is the game today?\u201d And across the board, I\u2019ve heard such good feedback about being able to see all the experts who have been there in the past, seen the changes and now looking forward because they have the experience in predicting, right? They\u2019ve predicted and been wrong and they predicted and been right. And I\u2019m super excited to see that. Garrett:  I am fascinated to hear your perspective because you have conversations with globally, like you\u2019re talking to academics, you\u2019re talking to VCs, you\u2019re talking to the leaders of Fortune 500s. Like you hear how people are talking about the direction of search, the direction of PR. From your perspective, the last like 12 to 24 months have been wild. What is the current state of digital PR, of search, of PR traditional in your, like from where you\u2019re coming from, your perspective? Lexi:  So, I think there\u2019s a lot of fear. I think we\u2019ve always feared technology. I\u2019ve done a lot of research into the history of technology and I\u2019ve gone back and found the first adverts, the first commentary letters to editors about mobile phones, which I adore all of that. We\u2019ve always had an aversion to change, which is weird because actually our adaptability has underpinned the survival of our species since the very beginning. And over the last few months, I\u2019ve realized I don\u2019t think this fear is superfounded. I\u2019ve had it. So, I can own that I sat there and panicked, but more and more I\u2019m realizing that this is just more opportunity. So, what I\u2019m noticing is yes, people are seeing traffic drops and they panicked, which they rightly should. Traffic has always been business, it has always been commerce, it\u2019s always been achieving your goal, whether you\u2019re an NGO or whether you\u2019re selling cat cupcake molds online, right? But what we\u2019re actually seeing is with the drop in traffic, we\u2019re actually seeing a high conversion rate coming out of a lot of the LLMs. They\u2019re giving people more of what they want and they\u2019re converting. So actually, we need to adjust what we were looking at before. We need to change our perspective and stand back and say, what is our original goal? And I think this is what\u2019s really going to segment the future marketeers and communication professionals. Who\u2019s always been focused on the end goal, the real goal, not how many pieces of coverage can you get, but how many pieces of coverage have you got that actually moved the needle? Can you own it? Because it has been the case since the beginning of my career. You go and get a piece in the New York Times, the Telegraph, USA Today, and absolutely nothing happens on the needle. I\u2019ve been watching metrics since as long as I can remember, I always loved them, but the needle doesn\u2019t move. And then you go and put a piece in Plumbers Monthly and the client rings you up and say, what did you do? And they\u2019re not even happy because they can\u2019t handle the inbound phone calls and they feel like they should have been told. You\u2019re like, well, I had no idea at that point that Plumbers Monthly was going to wipe the floor of the New York Times. But I learned a lot about trade press because I saw that pattern repeatedly in my career. And it took so much work to persuade clients to let us focus on trade. And what realistically has happened because a happy client doesn\u2019t burn time, which means they\u2019re not burning budget, which means they\u2019re not burning potential results. So, you have to go out and get the big hitters whilst you\u2019re secretly working on the stuff that\u2019s going to move the needle. But what I\u2019ve really seen across the board, because I\u2019ve actually audited all my past and all my present clients for LLM optimization, and trade media is kicking ass. That stuff has always been great for links, even though their domain authorities are lower, which again is another example of something we need to reconsider, their relevancy and their trust is high, higher than most of the tools we\u2019ve been watching have actually ever implied. And we\u2019ve seen it in ranking movements in the past, but now we\u2019re seeing an LLM optimization. And so people who have invested in trade are actually going to do better. Also, trade is one of the solid ways to get international. So, if you really want those hero pieces, you should be starting with trade to begin with. Garrett:  I love it. There\u2019s so much interesting stuff there, like too. Can you expand a little bit more of where you were going with that? Lexi:  Yeah, so in many ways, what we\u2019re seeing is that real stuff has had another place to show us a result, a result that\u2019s tangible that we can touch because there\u2019s a delay, right? You hire a firm or an employee to do a certain job, then they start doing it, but the results take a while. In between is abject panic on everyone\u2019s side, right? Because panic, stress is actually airborne, unlike oxytocin. So, it does actually transfer. And from my experience, it can transfer through Zoom too. So, you\u2019ve got this panic moment, whereas now we\u2019re seeing the LLMs are faster, right? And so we\u2019re seeing that the things that really move the needle are showing faster, which means clients are being encouraged to do the right thing sooner. There is no place in reality where doing the right thing sooner is really ever a bad thing, except if you feel like you didn\u2019t get on the AI bandwagon fast enough. And there were some bits of AI that I didn\u2019t feel like I got on the bandwagon fast enough with. I was focusing on one or two bits over here, primarily reputation, as you would expect. But now I\u2019ve realized the fact that I wasn\u2019t playing with the coding tools during that time is a good thing because they\u2019ve grown so fast. They\u2019re actually easier to use. That little middle bit isn\u2019t such a problem. And I think this is beautiful because there are so many people that I meet that are worried that they didn\u2019t get on this soon enough. They haven\u2019t made decisions, infrastructure changes soon enough. But actually that\u2019s not a bad thing. It\u2019s not too late. The rather late than never is actually completely changed here. Being late might actually mean that you make better choices. And we see this in third world countries, for example. New York City\u2019s internet infrastructure is tough. It\u2019s bleak, right? You\u2019ll get an apartment, there\u2019s only one service provider, right? Whereas third world countries looked at what the first world did. And when they put in their infrastructure, put an upgraded, more sophisticated infrastructure because they were later to the game. And now they have better connectivity than some of the first world. And I think we\u2019re going to see this in digital comms. We\u2019re going to see this in digital marketing. And one of the key things I really want people to walk away from with my talk is it\u2019s not too late. It\u2019s now. Now is perfect. Now is great. And they have more tools than ever before at their disposal. And also their integrity is going to survive. Integrity is your longevity. I was brought up by severe hippies, long-haired hippies, tie-dye t-shirts, the exact stereotype you\u2019re thinking of. And I was taught the internet was a place of opportunity and freedom. And it didn\u2019t look like that for many years because it actually became a place where who could spend the most, who could hack the most, who did the most devious things. And as the Google algorithm got more sophisticated, we noticed anyone who was cheating eventually got caught. What we see now, especially with LLM optimization, is if you\u2019ve tried to dupe Google that, I don\u2019t know, you sell eco-friendly produce, but you don\u2019t, the LLMs know. So, businesses with integrity who are themselves, truly deeply themselves, and express it, are getting the best results that correlate with their brand. So, I think the internet gets a new opportunity here because this is just an access point, right? It\u2019s not a new internet, it\u2019s a new access point. And I think that\u2019s awesome. And one of the things I\u2019ve been noticing, because I love bias, completely addicted to finding odd bias. For example, we have all these new ways that people can get support with debt. You can now chat with debt charities on WhatsApp. Well, that\u2019s great, unless you\u2019re a waitress, right? Because a waitress can\u2019t be sat chatting. So, a lot of these new access points have actually been exclusionary to certain people. You know, there\u2019s a bias in them. Well, what I\u2019ve noticed is the internet learned from old content forward, right? We had to wait for new content to be crawled and indexed. And that means that there is deep, deep, layer upon layer bias. Whereas the LLMs are learning from present back. They\u2019re a better version of us. The biases that we\u2019ve been correcting for are actually its first source material. And that\u2019s pretty exciting. And we see this when it comes to financial education. So, I\u2019ve always loved FinTech comms and FinTech marketing. And if you ask Google questions, if it knows you\u2019re a man or a woman, you get different results, right? We even see this on social media. Women get told, you know, maybe don\u2019t buy this handbag. Men get taught about compound interest. But what we\u2019re finding is that LLMs don\u2019t have that level of bias. So actually it\u2019s giving access to information to people who really need it. Well, if you\u2019re selling toilet paper outside a toilet door, you\u2019re at the right place at the right time with the right market. And that\u2019s what we\u2019re doing now. We\u2019re reaching the right people who desperately need and want your services. Well, that\u2019s loyalty. And we know that customer acquisition is one of the highest costs we ever have. Word of mouth actually has more dominance now than ever before because of misinformation. So actually this is awesome. Garrett:  Yeah, it\u2019s really interesting to see what direction it goes in, because I think there are on the one hand, less aspects of bias from the new information that gets pulled in more immediately. On the other hand, the way that we phrase our searches can be biased as well. I think the direction of these LLMs is going to be really telling because, whether it\u2019s just we get used to using ChatGPT or there are going to be three or four or five different ones of them. I am so excited to see the way that you break it down at your presentation, because you\u2019ve thought a lot about this. For those folks, those clients, whether it\u2019s a trade focus, what is something that someone can do like right now, like a practical action they can take from your perspective that would really help their business? Lexi:  Sure, so one of the things I\u2019m really cognizant of is existing in web 2 is how you exist in the webs thereafter. And I look at where people exist, because you want to own your identity in the same way you wanted to own your rankings, because you didn\u2019t want someone putting misinformation out about you. Go and register for a quoted profile. We see quoted profiles optimizing all the time in LLMs. They don\u2019t optimize as well on Google, but they definitely optimize in LLMs and with rich real estate. It\u2019s free, it\u2019s quick, it\u2019s easy. And once you\u2019ve done it, you\u2019ve done it. Because teaching Google who you are was actually a lot harder than I think it is to teach an LLM who you are. We also see that some legacy Google things have a good value. So exact match for an actual human name, optimizes super well in an LLM. And we\u2019re finding that consumers and journalists, especially are checking out their sources more than ever before. So, you might have a bomb ass brand, a bomb ass business, but the journalist is going to go check out your spokespeople. And so now you can roll the clock back a bit and get them an exact match domain, put them up a one-page site, say who they are, make sure that correlates with what\u2019s on their LinkedIn. Not rocket science, you can have a glass of wine and do it. And before you\u2019ve even finished the glass, get a quoted profile, teach the LLMs who your spokespeople are, almost as a primary before you teach them who your brand is, because that gives it source material. And what we\u2019re noticing is that they really do check whether someone is a reliable source. And I\u2019ve really enjoyed playing with this saying, why would I trust this person? And they know, it\u2019s so exciting. So, working on your personal brand, make sure that\u2019s rock solid, make sure you own that real estate, right? Because LLMs proliferate, so you need to get it right at source and then focus on the brand and get the brand profiles up on quoted. But sell first, like you would on an airplane with an oxygen mask. Garrett:  I love it, that\u2019s such a great recommendation too. I actually, I don\u2019t think I have one. I\u2019m going to jump off right after this, I\u2019m going to get myself set up with quoted. So, what\u2019s next? I mean, you\u2019re saying it\u2019s not too late for folks to jump on board. Obviously brand continues to be super valuable as these LLMs try to almost match the like real-life perspectives and social cultural sentiment on brands. What direction do you think we\u2019re going in? Lexi:  I think people are going to be forced to say, are we what we say we are? Because the LLMs will tell you if you are or you are not. And if you say you have brand values, well, where are they? They need to show and they need to be detailed. And so, there\u2019s going to be a lot of businesses and marketeers asking themselves hard questions. This is who we want to be, but are we it? How do we get there? And so actually it\u2019s becoming a self and business growth tool in this regard. The people who can look themselves in the eye and answer the hard question and then raise that question in a boardroom and then prove why it\u2019s important. And that proof I think is what a lot of people are going to learn in many different ways at SEO Week is how do I prove this? How do I win this argument forward? And I think that\u2019s awesome because we have more tools than ever before. We have more ways of measuring it and showing it, but we are going to see that authenticity and integrity is going to be the thing that wins in the future. Garrett:  There you have it. I\u2019m really excited to learn more about these different PR techniques, to hear your talk, to meet you in person. We\u2019re going to have so many good conversations at New York City SEO Week in a few weeks. Thank you so much for joining me today, Lexi. This has been a great conversation. Lexi:  Oh, it\u2019s a pleasure. I look forward to having lots of chats with you and all the other attendees. I will see you in a couple of weeks. Garrett:  See you then. \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t \n \n\t \n\t\t\t \n \n \n\t \n \n\t \t\t \n\t \t\t\t \n\t\t\tRelated Posts\t\t\t \n\t\t\t

Rand Fishkin will break down how discovery has changed and what marketers need to do beyond SEO to stay relevant.\u00a0 What the data actually says about how people find and buy today Why SEO alone won\u2019t cut it anymore (and what to do instead) How to build a marketing strategy that survives in a Zero-Click world \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t \n\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t Interview \t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t \n\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t Garrett : What\u2019s your perspective on the current state of search? Independent of pure SEO since I know that\u2019s not your jam. Rand : A lot of things have stayed quite similar in 2025 vs. the past 5 years: Google\u2019s the dominant player with ~90%+ market share. Bing, DuckDuckGo, Yahoo, Brave, and the AI search engines continue to be small competitors. It really only pays to go after them if your audience/field is using them heavily (e.g. lots of privacy-focused searchers use DuckDuckGo, many B2B professionals use ChatGPT/Perplexity, etc.). \u00a0 The big differences: Google\u2019s ranking system is mostly public. That\u2019s a refreshing change from the prior 25 years. Now instead of arguing whether Google uses something, at least marketers can argue about how much its weighted. Additionally, the share of searches answered without a click keeps rising. AI Overviews obviously accelerated that. I think at long last, more marketers (and their execs, teams, and clients) are recognizing that zero-click marketing and zero-click content has to be on the table; it can\u2019t just be about traffic anymore. \u00a0 Garrett:  Can you give us a sneak peek at your upcoming topic for SEO Week? What\u2019s most important to you right now, or any area within SEO, content, or AI you\u2019re passionate about? \u00a0 Rand:  I\u2019m talking about the end of traffic as the KPI for digital marketers, and how/why professionals who\u2019ve focused on that in the past need to change their strategic north star or be left behind by those who do. I also believe it\u2019s our responsibility \u2013 YOUR responsibility \u2013 to have the hard conversation with your boss/team/client/execs to get them on board with how the world works. Not all those conversations will be successful, but just as it\u2019s professional negligence in medicine not to tell a patient about a new treatment that might help them, it\u2019s negligent not to inform the people you work with that marketing\u2019s opportunities have changed. \u00a0 Garrett:  What\u2019s one actionable tip for our audience? \u00a0 Rand:  Stop pitching for links. Start asking for coverage (and doing things that deserve/earn coverage). Not only is it far easier to get a brand mention with press, blogs, websites, and other sources of influence than it is to request a link, it\u2019s also likely to be more influential long term (since LLMs don\u2019t care much about links and instead look at the proximity of text to other text). \u00a0 Garrett:  What\u2019s your perspective on what\u2019s next for search, whether it\u2019s about Google, AI, Brands, or the broader search ecosystem? \u00a0 Rand:  Unlike some prognosticators, I don\u2019t see Google dying or shrinking or changing market share more than +/-5% in the next decade. They\u2019ve got a powerful lock on behavior, an incredible war chest, an overpowering ecosystem, and fairly strong political leverage with the only government that might have held them to account (the US). If I had to guess, I\u2019d say that AI makes it into Google\u2019s results the same way self-preferencing entries like Google Maps, Hotels, Flights, Finance, Weather, Definitions, etc. did over the prior 15 years. If Google sees that their metrics go up when AI powers results, they\u2019ll keep using it, keep taking away traffic, and the opportunities in search will be primarily through getting your brand mentioned by the answers rather than your link posted in the top few results. \u00a0 Garrett:\u00a0 Thank you for answering these questions for us today!

If you haven\u2019t already got tickets, we are going to be in New York City, April 28th through May 2nd. It is going to be unbelievable, 35+ amazing speakers, experts in the industry. We\u2019re talking AI, content, SEO, and video. Speaking of which, I am joined today by none other than Phil Nottingham. He is the founder and producer at Organic Video. How you doing today, Phil? What\u2019s going on, man? Phil:  Very well, Garrett, thank you. Yep, all good. Garrett:  I am so excited to learn all about what you are going to be presenting. Video, obviously, has a place in my heart. I put way too much effort into my background and video efforts here. So, starting off, let\u2019s dive in. Where are we in the state of SEO in general and specifically in the context of video from your perspective? Phil:  Yeah, so I guess SEO more broadly, I guess we\u2019re in kind of just a state of flux where there\u2019s just a lot of change and a lot of movement towards thinking about things differently. So, I mean, I guess this has been true for a long time, but I\u2019m seeing it more acutely now where so much of what companies are doing is kind of anchored in an existence that was 10, maybe even nearly 20 years old now. And the reality of search and the complexities of just like how you think about what even a page is, like thinking about things in terms of entities, thinking about content as broader than the website and thinking of like this whole sort of holistic world in which you have to start sort of creating and optimizing for, as being so far removed from come up with a list of keywords and make pages that target the keywords, that it is just remarkable how kind of things have shifted. And yeah, I just don\u2019t think the mentality is there. So, we\u2019re in this state of flux that seems to be moving so fast that people can\u2019t keep up with it. And with video, it\u2019s sort of, I suppose we\u2019re in an interesting moment where I think from a search standpoint, it\u2019s like video is just integral to search now. It\u2019s just, it\u2019s part of YouTube and even TikTok ranking in search results. You\u2019re getting YouTube stuff pulled through in a bunch of the AI search results with Gemini and all that kind of thing. So, it\u2019s just like part of the mix and yet still very few people are really doing it. Or they\u2019re not thinking about it in those terms. They\u2019re not thinking of video as a search tool. They\u2019re thinking of it as primarily a tool for social media and maybe secondarily a tool for things like marketing automation, lead gen, that kind of stuff. So it\u2019s just, I think as a tool for acquisition, the world of search and video in relation to that, it\u2019s sort of, it\u2019s a new space and it\u2019s a space that I\u2019m spending a lot of time working in, but it\u2019s remarkable with the work that I\u2019m doing, how much it\u2019s just inculcating a whole new mindset of what video can do to like harness and improve your search efforts. And some of the simple stuff there is just like thinking about part of your content research, your keyword research as having a video component to it and then starting to plan for that with your content strategy and where your video lives across website, search, social media, email. Because really video to work well is kind of integral for all these platforms. On the like video specifically, maybe like that\u2019s quite broad and a more granular thing, two things that I\u2019d flag for the world of video right now. One is like last year, Google changed the way they sort of interpret pages and the way in which they will allow for certain pages to have a video result. And basically, they shifted a great deal to now only reward pages that kind of look like a YouTube page. So, a simpler video page, they won\u2019t, if a video is mixed media, if it has like a product page with a video on it, it\u2019s not going to rank with video results. But if it is like an individual sort of video player page, like you might have on Netflix or whatever, that will rank. So, one of the actions from that is kind of make sure you have that sort of video library sort of ecosystem on the website. And I think that\u2019s where, yeah, that should go. And I think that\u2019s a good shout. And then in terms of like the social side of video, I think the current big conversation is about basically short and long form and how it fits together. So obviously TikTok is sort of pioneered a format of short video that YouTube Shorts is increasingly having and the way in which that then interacts with stuff you might be creating for longer videos. There\u2019s a real sort of, there\u2019s certain kind of lengths that different types of videos kind of require and the way in which you need to think about it from a creative standpoint, it\u2019s quite interesting. So, for example, here we are doing a kind of podcast format. That\u2019s pretty long form. But what we\u2019ll probably find is off the back of this, there\u2019s like clips that you might want to think about having as short form. And it\u2019s then that whole structure of, okay, we have a longer form asset. We then need to work out a chop it up into clips. Those then go and serve as kind of shorts or subsequent videos. And then we have the long form video and they need to kind of relate together and fit in. And the YouTube infrastructure is kind of becoming better at handling that sort of, if you like relational hierarchy between different content assets. And I think most of our thinking is a little bit still isolated on singular content assets. So, there\u2019s a lot of thinking to be done there, I think in terms of like the creative process for how you make something long, turn in something short equally. Make something short and then maybe there\u2019s longer versions of it and how that all pieces together on the platform. So yeah, lots going on. Garrett:  Oh my goodness. And so good. And you gave us two really great actionable things out of that. One is having the library in the video, almost YouTube format for discoverability. And then the strategy around short term and long term. So that kind of leads right into your presentation, SEO Week. Why should people come and see you? Like, what are they going to learn? Phil:  Yeah, well, so I\u2019m still kind of working out precisely what I\u2019m going to talk about. So, I\u2019m kind of refining the details there. But I think the main thing, the kind of crux of that talk that I\u2019m going to give is around essentially codifying YouTube keyword researchers discipline. So, a lot of the tools out there that claim to YouTube keyword research, don\u2019t do YouTube keyword research. They, I don\u2019t know what they do. They just come up with numbers out of thin air. And if you think about the way YouTube works is it\u2019s not really like a, it\u2019s not just a search driven platform. Like part of it\u2019s search driven, part of it\u2019s just browsing, part of it\u2019s recommendations, part of it\u2019s about subscription. So, it\u2019s a very multifaceted platform in that regard that kind of straddles search and social media and feeds and all the other different kind of discovery platforms that we\u2019re used to dealing with. And in order to sort of research what you need to make on that, you need to think a bit broader than just like search terms and discover kind of, okay, what\u2019s hot? Where\u2019s there opportunity? Where\u2019s the market being slightly underserved? How do you kind of determine the key ideas that you should be investing in, the core topics? And so I\u2019m going to kind of basically lay out how to do that with some tools and explain the sort of actual data that you need to start gathering to kind of actually do that kind of analysis and provide a kind of step-by-step approach to doing that. So yeah, that\u2019s going to be where I\u2019m going with this. It\u2019s sort of trying to take what SEOs might be familiar with there\u2019s sort of a broader content strategy research, keyword research type activity that they\u2019re probably doing for their clients every month and really saying, \u201cwell, okay, how do you take that idea but apply it to YouTube effectively?\u201d Garrett:  That is so incredibly valuable because when I think about it and the direction that SEO is going, where we\u2019re moving away from singular keywords and thinking about entire like content gaps and topical authority and really having a breadth of content that covers everything that people are looking for, it kind of leads to my question of like, what\u2019s the next chapter of search when it comes to video? Because the other aspect of it that I\u2019m curious your take on is as Google and these tools are more effective at transcribing videos, understanding the audio and the video content and surfacing that in discovery of search, what do you think is going to happen going forward? Phil:  Yeah, I mean, I think it\u2019s integral in a bunch of directions. So, one thing, an example of this that might be worth thinking about is suppose you\u2019re doing a podcast interview like this, you\u2019re going to naturally cover a whole bunch of topics. And probably when most people do that, they don\u2019t kind of think about it in a keyword or topic sort of research-driven sense. But actually, if you do the work properly, you can kind of discover that there\u2019s probably an outline that the market is telling you it wants to hear in terms of the stuff you\u2019re going to talk about. And then those video assets that you\u2019re going to create are going to start to get clipped out, naturally pulled out with the transcripts feeding into generative search and kind of ending up populating the different search ecosystem in a way that you possibly hadn\u2019t predicted, because it\u2019s not quite like creating an asset for a target topic. So, it\u2019s a lot broader than that, but you\u2019re really just having to kind of anchor your understanding of what you want to be talking about based on what the market is asking for and what else it\u2019s watching, what else it\u2019s searching for. And just like the watch behaviors of audiences on YouTube will tell you a lot about what you should be making. And then you can feed that understanding back into your written content, into your website and all the rest of it. So, I think it\u2019s just a very useful lens into kind of the world that can, yeah, feed into product marketing and broader SEO as well. Garrett:  And it\u2019s so exciting. Thank you so much for your time. For anyone who hasn\u2019t gotten your tickets and wants to learn from Phil, make sure that you get your ticket for SEO Week in New York at the end of April. It\u2019s going to be unbelievable. Thanks for your time, Phil. I really appreciate it, man.

Check it out. End of April in New York City, all of the best, all of the best SEOs in the world are coming. Like this lineup is ridiculous. And we have the man when it comes to local SEO, Greg Gifford is the guy to talk to because he\u2019s like boots on the ground, knows the specific things you actually do. It\u2019s not just theory, like he knows the tactics. He\u2019s the COO at SearchLab. Thanks for joining me, Greg. How you doing, man? Greg:  I\u2019m great, man. I\u2019m excited to talk to you again. It\u2019s been a bit. Garrett:  Dude, it has. I mean, like every conference, you know, you got to find Greg because he\u2019s always having the best conversations. Like you\u2019ll jump in, you\u2019ll see, I\u2019ll see you like talking to someone and you\u2019ll just be surrounded in a circle talking SEO. I\u2019m really excited specifically about local SEO and your perspective of, because everything\u2019s changed so much in the past few years and local\u2019s kind of like the more changes, the more stays the same. What\u2019s your perspective on the state of local SEO right now? Greg:  Oh, geez. Um, I think the interesting thing is, you know, years and years ago, local SEO was like the redheaded stepchild of SEO. It was like one room of one small track at an entire multi day conference. And now you\u2019ll have like entire days or multiple days for local SEO because\u2026I still think the biggest problem is that most people that need it don\u2019t know that they need it and they do regular SEO instead of local. But like you said, a lot of the basics are still there. Like things that I talked about 10 years ago in conference presentations, 80% of that stuff is still true. The stuff that\u2019s changing is, you know, AI starting to encroach. Are we going to see it? I haven\u2019t seen it a lot in the localized transactional stuff yet, but they\u2019re starting to encroach there. Um, the biggest change really though, is Google trying to fight spam and fake listings and they\u2019ve dialed it up way too far and a lot of legitimate businesses are getting suspended lately. So that\u2019s like the biggest kind of issue and big thing going on in local is all the suspensions. Garrett:  That\u2019s really interesting. And that\u2019s, that\u2019s my big fear too, is all the false positives. I\u2019m really curious, it\u2019s not necessarily what you\u2019re going to speak about, but you guys at SearchLab just spent like the last two years studying over 1,600 Google business profiles in the automotive vertical. Greg:  Yeah, we did. Garrett:  What was the most interesting thing that you found from that? Greg:  Well, you know, it was, it was the whole purpose of the study wasn\u2019t to try to say, \u201cHey, this is a ranking factor and it matters more than others,\u201d because statistically, how do you really do that reliably? Right? Because there\u2019s not enough data out there that you can really, statistically say this thing\u2019s more important than this. So, we took a different approach. We studied these business profiles for 1,600 plus car dealerships across two years to see if the data backs up what everyone assumes and agrees best practices are. So, for instance, if you choose the right primary category, does that mean you\u2019re going to be better than guys that don\u2019t? So, we did it actually three different verticals. We\u2019ve only published the auto dealer one. We\u2019re about to publish the lawyer one, but we did it for car dealers. We did it for personal injury attorneys, because personal injury attorneys tend to be the most SEO forward and most aggressive with local SEO, and then we did it with cannabis dispensaries because they can\u2019t do paid search; the only marketing they can do is SEO. So, we wanted to kind of compare those, but within each vertical we have a section of, all right, this is just industry averages. So, across these profiles all over the country, here\u2019s the average number of reviews, the average response time, average number of photos, all these kinds of things. And then we compare position number one in the map pack to position number 10, which, you know, a lot of people think the map pack is just three, but when you click more locations, it goes to the local finder and shows you everything. So, we actually pulled data on one through 20 in all these cities. And so, we compare one to 10 and like, if you\u2019re doing something right, you should be at number one versus the guy at number 10 doing things wrong. And I color coded everything. So, some of the things that we tracked are ranking signal. Some of them we know don\u2019t affect ranking, but they\u2019re important for conversions. So, we\u2019ve got green and blue to delineate between, Hey, this influences ranking. This doesn\u2019t, but it\u2019s important. And then in the comparison section, I added in red where something didn\u2019t match. Like you would assume if you have more links, you\u2019re going to rank higher. Now obviously there\u2019s more nuance to that, but just in general, if you\u2019re doing link building, you probably have more links. You\u2019re going to rank higher. That actually didn\u2019t hold true when we compared number one to number 10, number 10 had more links, which we thought was interesting. But when you dig into the data, it\u2019s that I think it was Autonation. I don\u2019t remember who, but it was a big, big, massive group of dealerships and they have their own internal SEO team and they\u2019re going after the wrong metric. They\u2019re going for the total number of links, not the unique number of websites. So, all of their sites have like 4.6 million links from like 600 websites. So, if I took that one guy ranking number 10 out, that 4 million goes away. And then the numbers flip back to what you would expect that the guys at number one have more. I don\u2019t want to like make the number say what I want them to say. So, there\u2019s a couple of things that didn\u2019t match up and it was always because there was a couple of outlying situations where if you really took those numbers out, then okay, then things align with expectations. But review response time was pretty crazy. Sometimes it\u2019s like up to a week to respond to reviews. There\u2019s a lot of profiles where the average age of the last uploaded photo from the business owner is like six or seven years of time. So, a lot of people really approach it as a set it and forget it. They just upload their stuff and they optimize it and don\u2019t touch it again. Garrett : That is so fascinating because there are a bunch of levers that you can pull. Obviously, you\u2019re always tied within the proximity, you know, quandary that is local SEO of how strong of a ranking factor just where you are on the map. But like all these other things to test. And then to your point, when SEO, we always talk about tying it to revenue, which is those levers you can pull that aren\u2019t necessarily going to impact your rankings, but ultimately will impact how many sales you make, how many people buy. That kind of leads into how are you thinking about what you\u2019re going to be presenting at SEO week and why should people come and see all these gems that you just drop in terms of like the what to do? Greg:  Oh, well, you know, I, I feel like I haven\u2019t really chatted with Mike about the specifics of what I\u2019m going to talk about, but we did talk about it a little bit on the boat in San Diego at the boat party. And I think I\u2019m going to go a little more advanced this time. A lot of times I go pretty basic, but this time I think I might go a little bit more advanced and talk about some really cool things that you can do. There\u2019s some research that Joy Hawkins did about the default order of reviews. So, you know, when you first go to a reviews on a Google business profile, there\u2019s the default order before you click the filter to see newest or best or worst. She did some research about things that make reviews stick there longer, and then you can kind of take a leap and add all the things that she found together to bury bad reviews from that default really quickly. So that\u2019s a really cool advanced tip that we\u2019ve been using a lot lately. That\u2019s really successful. I\u2019m doing a talk at SMX Munich about using user generated content on your Google business profile for content ideas. And I\u2019m really enjoying what I\u2019m putting together there. It\u2019s basically saying, look at your reviews and see what people are talking about and the terms that pop up all the time. Make sure you have those same terms on your website. So, if it\u2019s good reviews saying certain things over and over, make sure you have that very clear and obvious on your website. Or if it\u2019s bad reviews saying the same thing over and over, do you not have the right answer on your website or what you have on your website isn\u2019t clearly matching expectations? What do you need to update? And I don\u2019t think a lot of people dig that deeply. I think people just kind of look at their reviews and don\u2019t see the gold mine of opportunities for things that you can write. And then, you know, look at your competitors reviews. Look at the Q and A section on your Google business profile where people are asking questions both for you and your competitors. So, I\u2019ll talk a lot about that. I have a really cool local SEO audit tool that we\u2019ve built in Google Sheets. That\u2019s a quick little mini tactical audit that we found very successful. So, I\u2019m sure I\u2019m going to share some information about that as well. So, it\u2019ll be kind of a quick little local SEO advanced masterclass. It should be really fun. Garrett:  Dude, I love that, especially for like the enterprise attendees who have located like all these nationwide locations, like next leveling up is so critical. And you know, we know each other going way back when I was working in a review software company where, you know, I am hyper aware of the value reviews. I remember looking at not just the default reviews, but what snippets were pulled out because it always has those three snippets. And like, depending on your review score, it\u2019d be like too good and one bad. Or sometimes if it was kind of crappy, two bad. It\u2019s like, how do you actually adjust that and asking for those reviews? So interesting, dude. Everyone should come to see what sort of research you\u2019re doing. And then my next big question is like, what direction? Like, I feel like local SEO has always gotten the short end of the stick by Google, you point out about spam and the false positive. What do you think is going to happen going forward? Do you think it\u2019ll be more of the same? Do you think we\u2019ll see more AI organized local results? What\u2019s going to happen? Greg:  I think for sure Google is looking at things they can do with AI to streamline the local business interface. Like you can already have an auto generated AI description of your business. I think they\u2019re trying to look for ways that they can help businesses make their profiles better because anything that you do to make your profile better makes it more engaging. And if more businesses do that, more people stay on Google. So, Google has a vested interest in keeping people on Google. So Google makes more money off of ads. So that\u2019s why they\u2019re kind of looking at these things. But they don\u2019t want to invest a lot of internal like FTE seats to do these things. So, I think they\u2019re looking at AI as ways to enhance profiles for people that don\u2019t know enough about how to do it. And then if you know enough about how to do it, you can obviously change those things. I think AI is coming for local results. We don\u2019t really see it much yet. Currently what we do see it\u2019s either really, really, really hallucinated or it\u2019s just pulling exactly what you\u2019d see in the map back in the same order anyway. So, there\u2019s no difference there. But I think more and more businesses are going to realize that local is what they really need to be doing. And I think the biggest thing moving forward is Google is aggressively trying to fight spam both in the form of fake business profiles and in the form of fake reviews. So, I think business owners and marketers should be ready for that onslaught of updates to make it harder and harder and harder to actually get verified and stay verified because Google\u2019s trying to crack down on all the fake stuff. And there is a lot of fake stuff. And does it suck when you\u2019re caught as a false positive? Sure. But the alternative is we leave a crap ton of spam out there that\u2019s bad for everybody. So, I think if you\u2019re just prepared for it, you know what to expect. It won\u2019t be the headache that it is now. Garrett:  One final question is for the longest time, I think for local SEO being an individual mom and pop small business, you had this advantage against enterprises where you really, you know, invested, you understood. At the enterprise level, do you think Google is going to \u2013 do enterprises continue to just lean on their brand awareness and visibility? Or are there more and more tools\u2026because like Google\u2019s never really given enterprises the tools to take advantage of the local space. Greg:  I mean, there\u2019s tools out there, but they\u2019re not Google tools. It\u2019s other software things that have been built. But yeah, local is massive for enterprise. You know, you think a little mom and pop, you make a tweak to a business profile, and it maybe gives you a little bit of a boost, or maybe it doesn\u2019t. But at the scale of thousands of locations, looking at that and going, oh, we don\u2019t have this category selected, and we should and you select that category across thousands of locations, you get a half a percent lift across 1,000 locations. And that\u2019s a massive difference for an enterprise business where a half a percent lift to a small business that\u2019s only getting 150 to 200 visits a month. They\u2019re not even getting an extra visit. And there\u2019s a lot of enterprise businesses out there that they really care more about the GBP side of it than the website side, because that\u2019s what it\u2019s all about is getting found in that local area. And so, finding the right tools to help with that, or the right information and know the things you should be looking at will be a game changer for enterprise. Garrett:  Huge is the opportunity cost. It\u2019s like if you choose not to pay attention to it, you\u2019re missing on so much available money. Awesome, dude. Everyone wants to find Greg wants to hear amazing local SEO tidbits.

My name\u2019s Garrett Sussman. And if you have not already bought your tickets, we\u2019re talking the end of April in New York City, the 28th to May 1st, four days of action-packed presentations from 35+ amazing, like the best of the best, cream of the crop speakers from all over the world. We\u2019re talking AI, data, local, news, e-commerce, SEO, content, you name it, everything is being covered. And I\u2019m so excited today. I\u2019m joined by one of the amazing experts in news in Google Discover. I\u2019m joined today by John Shehata, who is the founder and CEO at NewzDash. Thank you so much for joining me today, John. How you doing, man? John : Oh, all good. Thanks so much for having me, Garrett. I think this is the first time we meet on camera, I guess, right? But I can\u2019t wait actually for SEO Week to meet in person. So almost there, a few weeks. Garrett:  You are prolific. You\u2019ve been doing Nest for so long, you are plugged into everything news in our industry, everything SEO. NewzDash is such a fantastic, very specific tool. It\u2019s wild that you\u2019re running it all, you know, like when you\u2019re kind of running all over the place doing all the things, but let\u2019s dive in. The current state of search, the last 12 months, 24 months have been wild across general SEO, but even specifically in news. A lot of publishers dealing with a lot of challenges. I mean, they\u2019ve been dealing with kind of business model challenges for years now. What\u2019s your perspective on the state of search? John:  I think we\u2019re in a pivotal moment of search. It reminds me, like I\u2019m a little bit old school, like almost like doing this for 25 years now. Like the old days was the Florida updates and like all the big, big, monumental things that happened In search. I think now we\u2019re at a moment where Google is the evolution of Google, right? Not just Google, AI in general, right? So, you see AI overview in Google, you see AI mode, you see people, more and more people are using like chat GPT, not only for like, you know, tasks, but actually for doing search. So, there is a whole new frontier ahead of us, right? So, I think SEO, it\u2019s evolving in a whole different state right now. So, I\u2019m very excited about that actually in a big way. I see more and more challenges to news publishers or publishers overall, right? Less traffic is coming from Google, right? Discover is sending them a ton of traffic, but it\u2019s very hard to understand why or why they lose it. And then you see that not a lot of publishers still have reliable sources of revenue, right? Many of them still relying on like display, some of them a lot, few of them start like figure out the whole like subscription model and stuff like this. So I think it\u2019s going to be a little bit shaky for many publishers going forward. So, these are, I think the two big things, right? And I think brand authority is a topic that we don\u2019t talk a lot about, but I think like we need to go beyond like keywords and links and stuff like this. And I think about brand authority, and I know brand talks a lot about brand authority and zero click marketing. So, these are where we are right now. AI, AI overviews, Google evolution, right? Discover, more revenue sources, and what did we say? Brand authority. Garrett:  I love it. And especially for like news publishers, when you\u2019re talking to AI overviews, there\u2019s also this whole like copyright IP issue, you know, like whether it\u2019s in Google or, you know, New York Times is sued against ChatGPT, like how are they supposed to navigate that? John:  It\u2019s crazy. Like when AI first came, it was obvious that Google didn\u2019t want to get into the sensitive areas of content, but now more and more, I see like, I think I did the test a few months ago, and you can search for news and Google will tell you, \u201coh, this is what happened a few hours ago,\u201d right? So, there\u2019s a whole different frontier. Also ChatGPT, I shared this on LinkedIn the other day. I said, \u201cwhat happened, what are the top news today?\u201d Boom, boom, boom, boom, give you all the important news. What are the most important news in Europe? What are the most important news in sports? Can you tell me what happened with that Zelensky Trump situation? And it gives you like a quick brief as if like you don\u2019t have to read a hundred other articles, right? And it links to other sources and so on. So, there is definitely copyright IP issue here. Some publishers have direct agreements with ChatGPT and others, right? But still very few, right? Like in comparison to all the different publishers out there. It\u2019s going to be very interesting, especially with content summarization around news. Because we are at a time where people read less and less and we need things very quick, right? Especially with new generations, as well. So, it\u2019s going to be very interesting how news is going to be shifting to get to this like a very short attention span. Garrett:  It\u2019s tough. I mean, journalism is such a difficult industry to begin with. It\u2019s taken beat downs across the way. So, what I\u2019m really excited about with your presentation is you\u2019re going to get into a lot of the data of Discover. Can you kind of give a preview of what you\u2019re going to be covering at SEO Week and why people should catch your presentation? John:  Sure, absolutely. So, I don\u2019t know, something that not a lot of people know, I was the second site on Google Discover when it first started in 2018. And back then it was actually the, Google came to us and called the Nest and Google Discover back then used to be powered by RSS feeds. So that was fun. So, I love Google Discover. I love Google Discover because it\u2019s like this amazing area between search and social, right? It\u2019s like the right mix between the things and it\u2019s sending publishers a ton of traffic. Like you can see, we have so many publishers as part of our different tools. And we can see, we did a study for between 2023 and 2024. And we see that Google Discover traffic as from the Google Pi increased from like 40 something to 66%, right? Of all Google traffic that comes to news publishers, 66. I have seen 90% of some publishers, right? And then search on the other hand dropped from like 45-50 to 35-36, right? So, Google Discover is huge. And if you speak to Google, it\u2019s like, oh, there is no way to optimize for that, right? It\u2019s highly personalized, everything is personalized. While this is accurate, there\u2019s still many, many ways that you can understand why you\u2019re getting this traffic. And then you can optimize against that. You\u2019re not optimizing against each individual user but against your content characteristics. So, I dug down like 170, 180 million articles, right? And we start like seeing all these different patterns that emerge, right? So, I\u2019m trying in SEO Week, I\u2019m going to be talking about the path. Actually, I\u2019m going to talk about 11 different ways that you can optimize for Google Discover. And 11 ways that you can lose your Google Discover traffic. So, it\u2019s going to be interesting. It\u2019s all supported by data. So hopefully like just sharing as much knowledge as possible because Google Discover is still a very much a black box. Garrett:  Oh my goodness, it is. I\u2019m so excited for it. I\u2019m so curious. Give us a taste. What\u2019s like one practical thing that you can give away right now that someone can do to improve their Google Discover traffic? John:  Absolutely. Let me think of a good one. Want to keep them for the conference, but okay. Okay, syndication. All right, so a lot of times like we will have clients, let\u2019s say they write about technology in France, okay? And one of the tools that we have, NewzDash, is like we provide them what\u2019s doing very well in technology in US. And if they have the authority on that topic in their own language and their own country, and they take articles from other countries that are doing very well and write it, repurpose it, republish it, most of the time it works for them. So, you can get inspiration from so many different ways, not only what\u2019s trending in your market, but you can actually take inspiration from like bigger, other countries that this vertical might be like bigger or like has more content around it. And that actually helps a lot. We see a success rate of like 70+ percent for this kind of like content translation or adaption from one language to another. Garrett:  That\u2019s such an interesting approach. And it does make a ton of sense, especially content syndication is always something like, it feels like a taboo thing to talk about, and yet it\u2019s so like critical to the journalism industry. So, what\u2019s next? What do you think is going to happen with publishing and Google and SEO over the next few years? What do you predict? John:  I think we are at a transition stage with SEO. And I think SEO was after AI or 2025 and beyond will be greatly different from what we used to do, right? We kept saying, talking about like entities for a long, long time. I think keywords is becoming more and more obsolete. It\u2019s more focused on entities. I think SEOs need to learn more about AI. I\u2019m not saying everyone needs to be a technical wizard like Mike King, but definitely like, you need to understand the concepts. You need to understand how AI is influenced. How is it influenced by what sources, right? You need to understand a lot of that, right? I think AI agents for SEO will be a huge thing. We\u2019re looking into different ways of doing this, but imagine the amount, the time you can save on all these mandate jobs. I think editorial teams will slowly adapt to the idea of having AI as one of their power tools in the newsroom. I\u2019m not saying like they\u2019re going to use it to write complete articles, but you can use it for research and summarizations and so many other things to make the whole thing efficient. I think these are some of the things I personally are excited about, but definitely SEO will be different 2025 going forward. Garrett:  I agree. You got my head exploding because I\u2019m thinking about the agentic AI of like, something as simple as curating your own newsfeed more effectively with an up-to-date agent or something like, I know when you\u2019re talking to key sources like being able to extract subject matter expert quotes with AI more effectively as a journalist. So much you can do. I\u2019m so excited, John. I\u2019m excited to chat with you like face-to-face. We\u2019ll get a chance to talk about all this stuff. It\u2019s going to be great. So, if you haven\u2019t already gotten your tickets for SEO Week, you can get it at seoweek.org. Check us out. We\u2019ll be there in New York at the end of April. John, thank you so much for joining me today. This has been fantastic. John:  Thank you so much for having me. Can\u2019t wait to see you guys.

We are coming up on it. If you haven\u2019t already gotten your tickets, I\u2019m talking the end of April, the 28th to May 1st, four days of just ridiculously talented, smart people, 35+ across AI, SEO, data, content, you name it. And speaking of really smart and cool people, I\u2019m joined today by Andrew Prince. Andrew is the senior SEO manager at Rocket. Thanks for joining me today, Andrew. How you doing, man? Andrew : Hey, thanks for having me, Garrett. It\u2019s great. It\u2019s a sunny day here today in Michigan in March, so can\u2019t complain. Garrett : Dude, your role is wild. I know always with in-house, there\u2019s like things you can say, things you can\u2019t say. Recently in the news when this was recorded, you guys bought Redfin, but just generally speaking, you\u2019re at this massive enterprise company. You\u2019ve been in SEO for a long time now. What is your perspective? The last 24 months have been wild. What\u2019s your perspective on the current state of search? Andrew:  Yeah, a lot going on. I could take this any number of directions, but what I\u2019d say, especially as an in-house SEO is you only need to know what you\u2019re working on, the sites you\u2019re on, the industries you\u2019re in. Like, I don\u2019t necessarily need to know local SEO anymore. I love it and I like staying up on it, but as an SEO, so many times it can be overwhelming when there\u2019s so many things going on of where do I focus my time and energy and where do I learn. Especially as an in-house SEO, for me, it\u2019s the mortgage side, it\u2019s technical at scale, it\u2019s some of the content at scale. As far as the current state of search, I think the hot topic is AI search and what does that look like. In SparkToro\u2019s recent data study, as far as 330X plus more searches on Google than ChatGPT, after I saw that, I put my family group chat, \u201cHey, who\u2019s used AI and who\u2019s used ChatGPT?\u201d And only one person out of the six people in the group chat have. So, I think sometimes in our space, it\u2019s such a tech siloed space where we\u2019re like, \u201cThe world is ending,\u201d but is the average consumer actually adopting it and changing? So, my recommendation, the current state of SEO is keep your pulse on things, but focus on what\u2019s actually going to matter to your company. And the adoption of AI search is still going to take a little bit longer time than what I think we are expecting. I know that probably pains you because you\u2019re one of the people at the forefront of AI. That\u2019s the great thing about SEO is we never have to agree on everything. Garrett : I think it\u2019s a really great point. It is so easy. And it\u2019s funny, one of my obsessions with psychology of search is we get caught up in these bubbles, to your point, of thinking everything\u2019s a certain point, data tells you otherwise. You have to remember to talk to real people who are your actual audience or who are the real world. And speaking to the kind of niche or the focus, you guys had a massive migration. Can you kind of give a preview? I\u2019m really excited to hear what you\u2019re going to talk about in SEO Week. Why should people come check you out? Andrew:  Yeah, I\u2019m pumped. So, what I\u2019ll be talking about is Rocket.com was acquired for $14 million by Rocket, one of the top five public domain acquisitions all time. So, it was crazy. A couple of years ago, our SEO team said, \u201cWe have Rocket Mortgage, Rocket Homes, Rocket Loans, Rocket Solar, right?\u201d We had so many Rocket brands. We just dreamed of, \u201cWhat if we combined all of them into one site? What would that look like?\u201d But that stayed as a dream until we brought in a new CMO, Jonathan Mildenhall, who previously was at Airbnb and Coca-Cola. And he said, \u201cWe need to unite under one brand and a core creative idea of own the dream.\u201d We did the Super Bowl ad. But with the Super Bowl, they said, \u201cLet\u2019s buy this Rocket.com site and have it ready to go in time by Super Bowl,\u201d which is only a few months after the fact. And you know, as an SEO, when you\u2019re dealing with a multi-million page website, what in the world do you prioritize? How do you go to executives and say, \u201cMaybe let\u2019s slow our roll? What\u2019s feasible on this timeline? What do we set aside for the future?\u201d So, I\u2019m going to be talking through some of those decisions, how we approached it, how we mitigated as much risk as possible. And then the big thing in 2025 with entities and branding and things of that nature, Rocket.com was an aerospace engineering website. So how did we actually think about separating the old entity of what the site was with what our goal of what Rocket is? Garrett : It is so fascinating. It\u2019s like to your point, it\u2019s like one of the most epic case studies for a website migration, just like, in the history of the internet. It is because there\u2019s so many, but like we can\u2019t even come to terms with the moving parts, not only of the sheer scale of the actual website, but the complexity of working at such a large business with so many different lines of business. Andrew:  It\u2019s very exciting. Garrett : So specifically, what is one like tactical thing that someone who\u2019s watching this right now can do, whether they\u2019re preparing for a website migration or something more general? Andrew:  Yeah, I would say have as detailed of a plan as you can. So shockingly, we were within one week of what our initial plan was several months out. And it wasn\u2019t just, oh, when this happens, when that happens, we had, we\u2019re going to crawl our dev site these three days, we are going to put a splash page up and it needs to have this amount of lead time. It was so detailed in what we did that when you go to present that type of plan to an executive, it\u2019s hard to poke holes and argue with when it was so well thought out. You also can\u2019t just have one plan. So, you have a recommendation as to what to do. But in SEO, of course, things always change. So having some backups, but being really, really, really detailed in the initial one so that you have a good idea as to what marks need to be hit and when things need to escalate. So if something doesn\u2019t hit a deadline, when do we go to executives and say, \u201cHere\u2019s the risks involved with it?\u201d So very, very, very detailed migration plans. You can\u2019t think through it enough. Garrett : Dude, I mean, it\u2019s yeah, you can\u2019t overestimate the amount of planning and even still. So that\u2019s wild that you came within one week. That is such a I can\u2019t wait to see this, this presentation. So beyond just Rocket, what\u2019s next from your perspective in terms of the world of search? You\u2019ve been paying attention, you know, whether you think that, you know, people are going to use AI or it\u2019s just a lot of hype and it\u2019ll just kind of go away and we\u2019ll all be like, you know, laughing about it years from now. Where do you think we\u2019re going in terms of the industry and search in general? Andrew:  Yeah, I love how the SEO Week lineup as it currently stands has myself and then Nick Eubanks of SEMrush after me talking about acquisitions, because as you said at the beginning, we\u2019ve come to an agreement at Rocket to purchase Redfin that hasn\u2019t necessarily closed yet. There\u2019s still a lot of details to be worked out. But when you think through the big players in home search and how much time it would take Rocket to be able to become one of those, or you can just acquire all of that home search top of funnel, like that\u2019s a decision at a company of this size that can be made. SEMrush did something very similarly. SEO is going big time the way of brands and big brands. And you think of LLMs and getting brand mentions on other sites. I think we\u2019ll see much more acquisitions and mergers. What does that mean for SEO teams? Do you merge things? Is it separate? Who owns what? What does that look like? Who knows? I\u2019m going to throw one interesting thought-provoking thing at you, Garrett. You know how Google has always kind of failed on the social side, like Google Plus? Garrett : What? Google, they shut down Google Plus? When did that happen? (laughter) Andrew:  Yes. But TikTok, right? Of, oh, is it going to be disbanded? What does that look like? What people haven\u2019t necessarily thought of is if TikTok were to sell off in the US, imagine if Google bought them. Imagine if Google all of a sudden ran TikTok and what they would do from a user data perspective. So sometimes it\u2019s the devil you don\u2019t know side. And that\u2019s an acquisition I\u2019m sure Google could make, and it would certainly be interesting. So, acquisitions, bigger players, bigger brands, scaling, I think is more of the direction we\u2019re going to see as winners in search long term. Garrett : I\u2019m with you on that. I don\u2019t know how I feel. One thing I was talking about the other day is the idea of where we\u2019ll land with the DOJ antitrust trial. Because I\u2019m thinking about that in the sense of TikTok and there\u2019s already people have such an issue with the preferential treatment that Google gives to YouTube. Do you think Google at this point is too big to fail? Or do you think that we might see an intervention and divestiture of Chrome? Or you have no idea? What\u2019s your instinct? Andrew:  I don\u2019t think it matters, honestly. Garrett : Explain. Andrew:  Truly, I think Google has enough data that sure, you break this up and we\u2019ll approach things from a different viewpoint. The level of data that they have is completely unmatched. If you take away Chrome, if you take away in the mortgage space, if you search for a while mortgage calculator, mortgage rates, they had their own thing. You see it with flights and hotels and what have you. You take that away and Google can start ranking their own site number one, they can still do various things. They run ads in certain ways. Google\u2019s always going to win in this space. The fact as a community, we keep thinking AI tools are going to take over and Google\u2019s market share is still as high as it is. Maybe they fail long term. The crazy thing is Google\u2019s been around fewer than 30 years. What do I know? I think Google\u2019s too big to fail. You should hedge your bets slightly, spend some time, keep your pulse on things. Google\u2019s where the priority is now and at least in the short-term future. Garrett : This conversation gets me so excited. I can\u2019t wait to talk to you in person. For folks, if you\u2019ve never heard Andrew speak or you just really work in enterprise, you want to learn more about some of these best practices, he knows that he\u2019s in the weeds. Make sure you get your tickets for the end of April, the 28th to the 1 st , in New York City. We have single day tickets. Andrew is on day four on Thursday, which is The Future, which is a really exciting day. I think both Lily Ray and Rand Fishkin are on that day. You mentioned that Eubanks is right after you. It\u2019s impossible, all these days are pretty amazing. Andrew:  And I\u2019ll make the pitch too. I\u2019ll be there all four days. So find me. I promise to wear different colored glasses every single day. So you\u2019ll have to follow on LinkedIn or Twitter to see what color to hunt me down and find me. But certainly say hello. I am so excited to be there. New York City is a great city. The venue is awesome. Great speaker lineup. So excited. Garrett : There you go. SEO Week, SEOweek.org. Check us out. Thanks for joining me, Andrew. This has been great. Andrew:  Yeah, of course. Thanks for having me, Garrett. Garrett : I\u2019m Garrett, and we\u2019ll see you in New York in April. Sound good? Okay.
